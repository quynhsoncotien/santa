To Gemini, their partner will seem too depressed and dark for no apparent reason, and for Scorpio, this could be an experience with no purpose or depth. If they do fall crazy in love, they could connect through their mutual love of change and give each other the exact things they lack. Gemini would get deep, emotional satisfaction they have never felt before and Scorpio would finally get the chance to rest their troubled soul, and realize that not everything needs to be taken seriously.

        "text": "A sexual relationship between a Gemini and a Scorpio is like a connection of the deepest and the highest point on planet Earth. Gemini is so far off from Scorpio’s emotional world that good sex between them seems like something almost impossible to happen. This couple needs to be supported by other positions in their natal charts if they are to stand any chance of lasting in a loving, sexual relationship.\nGemini can be superficial and there is no other sign who knows this better, than Scorpio. Their Air element combined with the rule of Mercury and its lack of emotion is close to Scorpio’s worst nightmare.Scorpiois a sign of our deepest emotions and as such, linked to the most intimate side of sexuality. When they begin a relationship with Gemini, it probably never crosses their mind that such an asexual person can exist in the world.\nIf they fall in love with each other, there is so much for both of them to learn. Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at. If their mutual respect is at a very high point, Gemini could teach Scorpio that not everything needs to be so fatalistic in their sex life. In return, Scorpio will give their Gemini partner depth and emotional vibe to sex that they have never encountered before.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

        "text": "The good thing in their relationship is that they both value strength of thought. Although Scorpio values many other things in someone’s personality, they will be impressed by someone’s intelligence and resourcefulness. Gemini will focus on the same thing, but have a slightly different assessment of someone’s intellect. However, they can agree to have a shared point of same value, although other things they strive for will differ greatly.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Cancer wants someone responsible, to take them by the hand if needed and complement their emotional nature with practicality. Libra wants someone who is full of life, energized, strong and full of initiative to follow their ideas. They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens.

Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.",

        "text": "As both of them are signs of relationships – family relationships or relationships with partners – they will both value a pleasant and joyful connection between two people. If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find. However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn't sound promising, does it?\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner.

The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet.

In combination with other signs of the zodiac it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.\nThe problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away.\nTheir different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

While Taurus would create and motivate, Capricorn would lead the way to success and financial security. Whatever their goals, they could easily reach them together due to the fact they share the same material values to begin with. Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

When you study Astrology, one of the first things you will learn is that Aquarius is the sign of divorces, breakups and setting free from regimes and relationships. As a sign that carries opposition within, they are often not easy to be with for any sign of the zodiac, but this is exactly something both of them could understand in each other. If they truly respect each other, there is a great chance they will learn to understand other things in each other’s lives too.\nAs crazy as it may sound, these two partners have a great chance of staying together because they will know each other better than anyone else could. However, they are rarely that attracted to each other, and even when they are, it is very difficult for them to form a deep emotional bond. When they do, well… the sky isn’t the limit.",

They will fulfill each other’s fantasies without any repression, and easily find a language in which to connect their strange sexualities. Both of these partners will have trouble fitting in the usual stereotypes of sexuality and will rarely understand the usual taboos and restrictions other people tend to impose.\nStill, they could find an obstacle in emotional bonding that could present itself through a general lack of intimacy in their sex life. This will not quench the desire they will feel when they are truly attracted to one another, but they could be too detached for any of the partners to give enough warmth or focus to their relationship. This is why as soon as the first excitement and attraction start to fade, and the need for true emotional contact emerges, they might have trouble staying together.\nHowever, if they are both looking for an occasional fling, this might be the best contact of signs in the entire zodiac to have one. There will be no better understanding for the sense of freedom and the need for the lack of intimacy as these two might have in certain conditions. Unfortunately, this is usually not enough to support their future together and they will both probably need someone they could love more and who would care about them in a different way.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

But when we look at the sign of Aquarius we see that what they value is closely connected to their home and the way they were raised. As two rebellious, opinionated people, they need similar upbringing if they are to understand each other. The good thing is that they both value their freedom to extremes and this will connect them even when there are many other things they disagree on.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Their sexual relationship is hardly promising, but they both have the need to communicate. If they find a language they both understand, they might agree on the way their sexual life is to progress. However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves. To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

In fact their relationship can show us exactly how relative intelligence is. Their meeting point is actually in their emotional intelligence, not our typical one. However, they do value rationality, someone’s ability to reason and one’s practical use of their hands and their brain.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations.

This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided.

All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long.

If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.\nThe best possible scenario for their relationship would be for them to get to know each other very well and build a friendship without expectations, for years. In the end, this could result in deep understanding that would provide them both with enough patience to actually start a relationship that has a future. If not, they can always hold on to beauty in the world. Imagine how wonderful their world of creation could be if they joined their forces of good.",

With their childish attitude that changes with the weather, there seems to be no room for any sexual activity in their life. Although this is a delusion, these signs are too far apart in their basic character to understand each other’s sexuality. Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths",

However, they could find themselves in a relationship that doesn’t have enough emotion and compassion, and this is certain to surface as soon as the first disturbing thing happens in the life of one of these partners.

They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

Leo’s warm nature and passionate approach to all things in life, including sex, will keep them satisfied together for a long time. However, there is a face behind the act to both of these partners that they might be too proud to show. They usually search for partners that can help them show their core in order to really connect instead of simply having sex as an instinctive act.\nThe main problem that two Leo partners can have are their boundaries and the possible lack of respect they have for each other. While they would both enjoy being with someone who is so confident, they might hold on to the image of confidence for way too long, until all sorts of insecurities surface. It is difficult to develop closeness with all that fire in one place and when you think about it, there is only one Sun in our Solar system and everything revolves around it. Then what do you think, can it be possible to have two of them in one bed, circling around each other?\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind.

As if they were real little lions, these two are capable of truly enjoying their leisure time and each weekend could seem like paradise.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet.

Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality.

Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two.

Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it.

Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make.

He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word.

Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful.

Then Gemini comes along and starts explaining each position, the interesting overview on Kama Sutra and the beauty of outdoor sex. It is almost unbearable to watch these partners with their completely different philosophies while they try to maneuver their sex life.\nIn order for Capricorn to experiment in sex, their partner needs to manage to really relax them and open their mind. With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models.

Attraction they feel toward each other is great, but their signs combined present passive-aggressive behavior in general and as a couple they could have a tendency to hurt each other in intimate relations.\nRuled by Mars, Aries is a sign of Saturn’s debilitation and Libra exalts it, so their main issue is the lack of emotion and poor boundaries when it comes to sex. Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

This is an interesting observation because the sign of Aries is the sign of Saturn’s debilitation and doesn’t seem to understand the set of values or exact steps that would lead them to their goal. It is almost as if Libra knew the way for Aries to reach their goals by discovering new values in relationship with them.\nIn general, their individual values are different in so many ways, but it is exactly the purpose of their relationship to question them and set them straight. Aries values direct, energized approach and outspoken people. Libra values tact, fineness and prestige. While Aries gives their best to live in the now, Libra examines the past to set distant targets in the future. They have a lot to learn from each other, but if they do, they might just set their mutual values somewhere in the middle.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to.

She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it.

The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for opinions of other people, so representatives of this sing go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality. They will either be afraid to be judged and seem too asexual, or have a need to show it “in spite” of everyone’s opinion and this can be quite repulsive for their partner. When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

This could represent a big problem in their relationship, and Libra partner could seem clingy and not at all independent, while Aquarius might seem like an uncontrollable lunatic who would do anything to destroy all relationships in the world. Still, they both value communication and intellectual strengths enough to talk about their needs and desires, and this should help them overcome their differences.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

As squaring signs, they should have a very troublesome contact, but the sign ofScorpioexalts the ruler of Aquarius, Uranus. These signs combined represent the ultimate sexual freedom, a place with no restrictions or taboos. They are a combination of Water and Air, of emotion and information, all combined in a strong scent of attraction. If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Unfortunately, most of the other things they would value in their partner are completely different. While Aquarius values free spirit, communication and independence, Scorpio values commitment, sex and deep emotional connection.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia.

Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality.\nCancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

As much as they will both value being loved and cared for,Cancerwill value a stable emotional situation and a cozy home to come to, while Pisces will probably value any chance for an emotional rollercoaster more. It is often said that Pisces idealize partners and different things in life, but in fact they get depressed when there is no magic and perfect beauty surrounding them. If their day to day life with a Cancer partner becomes anything similar to a boring routine, they will find a way to run off, find a lover or create any sort of truly exciting circumstances.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

        "text": "Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

        "text": "It is truly interesting to watch this couple share values with such a difficult relation to Venus and the term of value itself. Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Even though Virgo can be quite demanding and critical, especially from the point of view of Sagittarius, their sex life can be satisfying for both. The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

This is why they will both treasure someone able to adapt, change and move, which is definitely something they will find in each other as they start their relationship. As highly mental signs, they will also both value clarity of mind and intelligence, in general. Still, their approach to intellectual value is different, and as much asVirgovalues depth and detailed analysis, Sagittarius will value the width of one’s mind. Even though they differ in other things they value greatly, Virgo valuing practicality and Sagittarius vision and focus, there is enough common ground here for both of them to feel good when together.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

        "text": "The fact that Aries is ruled by Mars and Taurus by Venus immediately shows us how sexual these signs are. Both planets are in connection with physical relations, but their biggest difference is in their final goal when it comes to sex.\nAries in its rough form is guided by a simple instinct, the need for continuation of the species and the transfer of genetic material to the next generation. On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.",

They both value material security, since Aries is ruled by Mars, a planet connected to the fear of existential crisis, and Taurus is an Earth sign, material in their core and very inclined to the financial world. They both cherish character and strength, physical and verbal, and need someone who will not disappoint them as the first impression fades.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.",

Although their chances to reconcile their differences are slim, if Taurus partner puts their whole heart into it, they might manage to become the most relevant part of their Gemini’s life as their base and their reliability in everything they do. In case they accept each other completely, Taurus will give Gemini their connection to planet Earth, to their body and their daily routine, giving them the base for health and normal functioning. In return, Gemini will give their Taurus wings and, better yet, teach them how to fly.\nBecause the sign of Taurus normally lacks initiative, Taurus men can easily get a panic attack when it is time to conquer the subject of their desire. There is a collision between their traditional values and their gentle nature. Any situation in which they are not sure about their assessment of someone’s emotions is an emotional slippery slope. When they make a decision to make the first move, this will usually be a product of a long analysis of the way the other person was acting, even though they might not even be aware of it. If a Taurus man is secure about the way he feels and understands emotions of his partner, he will be a gentle lover who takes care of his loved one for a very, very long time.",

Gemini needs intellectual stimulation and doesn’t care that much about spending time in someone’s arms. It is not as if they don’t have the need to be touched, we all do, but they have to know they are loved and accepted in so many different ways and touch is just one of them. After all, they are one of the Air signs and in their world thoughts have to be preoccupied, while strong communication is something that gives the possibility of a good sexual life.\nWhile Taurus could stay at home, in bed, all they long, cuddling with their sweetheart and ordering food, Gemini would like to get out and be intimate at all not so intimate places. Their sex life could become the source of most of their problems, as soon as Gemini gets bored or Taurus annoyed by the lack of emotional essence.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.",

This is where their differences and element natures strongly diverge. They should really try hard to accept the true value of both their worlds in order to work out their differences.\nHe is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.",

With Leo’s confidence, and Libra’s sexuality, they tend to inspire each other to become great lovers when together. Their sex life is usually filled with respect, and they feel free to try out new things with one another. If they found their relationship on a strong mutual attraction, they could enjoy a satisfying sex life for a very long time.\nLeo doesn’t mind being seen and Libra is a sign that represents the public eye. Although this says something about their sexual preferences too, they will usually be well behaved in public. As soon as any restrictions show up, they will have to play out their passionate scenarios at any time, and in any place in which they get a chance to be alone if only for a minute. Libra is a sign of Saturn’s exaltation and it is easy for them to wait and be rational, but with passionate Leo they find it hard to stay in control.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

Libra, on the other hand, values justice and one’s ability to be the hero – something they often think they lack. They are finely compatible when it comes to matters of the Sun and they complement each other well in a way that helps them both learn about expressing themselves and their abilities and strengths. The problem with this couple is in their relationship toward Saturn, and while Leo represents its detriment, Libra exalts it. Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

This is a very interesting couple in the domain of sexual activity – one of them hiding their sexuality, and the other acting as sex itself. Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

There is nothing in the world that is as exciting as conversations that are so intense and so challenging for their minds. Most of the time they will agree on things they value most, although they might stumble upon a huge problem when they get to the point of throwing out the trash. Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo. Just imagine as their first child is born and Scorpio wants to frame that dried out residue of an umbilical cord. Do you think Virgo would want to wake up to this in their apartment every morning?\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.",

Of course they both want true, magical, mystical love with Venus exalted in Pisces, but Taurus values tenderness and touch on their way to get there, while Libra values responsibility and seriousness. However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

In return, Sagittarius will have to lower their expectations on Cancer’s own changeability and sexual creativity, and be satisfied with lovemaking instead of a sexual adventure.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come.

If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves.

It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year.

To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

They will go everywhere together, do everything together and talk about everything with one another, again and again, until one of them loses interest in the other. Because of their possibly superficial approach, it is best if they have already had some relationships with depth before they met each other. This could give them the quality to last together for longer than a week or two.\nIn most cases, this is not a relationship they will want to stay in, although their mutual understanding is perfect. It is like they are too similar, and at the same time a relationship of too many personalities. If each of them isn’t gathered into one person, they will need someone who is, to hold their balance and not let them dissipate. In case they have built up personalities and each of them understands their own inner core, they can probably live forever and never consume the energy their connection brings.",

The image that comes to mind could easily be the image of two people with split personalities, trying to have sex by banging their heads together and talking at the same time. Although they will most certainly have an abundance of information on sexual activity, only after they have had some experience can they become great lovers. It is very rare for aGeminias an Air sign, to be practical and find the way to manifest what they’ve read or heard about in the realm of reality and physical body. Their biggest quality is the ability to learn. With their desire to become great lovers, they will absorb knowledge through each of their relationship like a sponge.\nTwo Gemini together will share information and coordinate their previous experiences with one another. They will be more satisfied when they teach their partner something, than they will be by sex itself. With their open minds and creative wit, there is probably not a single place they wouldn’t want to have sex with, nor a position they wouldn’t want to try out. It is not like they are promiscuous, but find joy and excitement in the change of scenery, especially if there is relative movement involved, too. So imagine a train, an airplane restroom or any means of transportation in which it is possible to hide.\nHowever, their sexual life can become empty when the excitement has passed if none of them has enough depth to bring into the act of sex. They are not even aware of the focus and emotional connection they need, until they find the right partner. Usually this is not another Gemini. Their hearts should be dug up and their relation to sexuality changed, before they get together with one of their kind. Any other scenario probably won’t keep them satisfied for very long.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.",

This is a value that two Gemini will passionately share. They don’t like to be bored with tiresome details, obligations of a meaningful relationship, or their partner’s need for compassion that is not to be asked for. The problem is in the fact that they think too much, and feel much less. If they could get out of their head for a couple of seconds, they might realize that their chest is crying out for intimacy, closeness and compassion\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

When they start dating, their sexual relationship might come as a surprise for both of them, for they will feel liberated to be exactly who they are with each other. The best thing they could do is use the trine between their Suns and build-up each other’s self-esteem, especially if they have been in demanding or disrespectful relationships prior to theirs.\nThe best thing about their sex life is the passion they share. Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons. They will both enjoy each other in a fiery way and respect each other’s bodies, minds and entire personalities. If they stumble upon one another and love is born, their sex life could represent a perfect connection for both of them.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you.

On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people. So although they value the same thing – courage, they see it through different eyes.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths",

She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

If attraction and love are born between them, they will rarely have a damaging relationship for any one of them, because their signs are ruled by the Moon and beneficent Jupiter. It is safe to assume that they will be good for each other, for as long as their relationship lasts, but it is rare for them to succeed in the long run if they don’t have strong support from positions in their personal horoscopes. As much as Cancer can reach the depth of their partner’s faith, Sagittarius can widen their partner’s horizons and make them much happier in their approach to the world.

If they do, against odds, they could find an interesting shared sexual language that none of them anticipated will be found. The changeable nature of Sagittarius can be somewhat difficult for Cancer to understand because of their opposite need for emotional security. If trust between them is reached in any possible way and true emotions are shared, this characteristic of a Sagittarius partner will become a spice to their sex life, rather than its destructive force.\nIf they have enough emotional security with one another, their sex life could be very fun.Canceris a sign that exalts Jupiter, and will probably make their partner feel special. On the other hand, Sagittarius will make things light, fun and although the lack of depth could bother Cancer, passion and warmth they bring into their sex life might just be enough to compensate.\nThe only way their relationship can succeed is for Cancer to let go of their preconceptions and allows some change and fun enter their strict sex zone. Although they can seem mellow most of the time, they have a tendency to hold on to secure patterns when it comes to things that can make them feel shame or insecurity. In return, Sagittarius will have to lower their expectations on Cancer’s own changeability and sexual creativity, and be satisfied with lovemaking instead of a sexual adventure.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

Cancer will value Sagittarius’ honesty and their ability to act on emotional impulse, even if they don’t understand the emotion behind the act. Sagittarius will value Cancers dedication to things they love and their incredible ability for compassion.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures.

He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

There is a strong link between these two signs, and in their sexual relationship, things will most certainly never get boring. At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\nAs a mutable sign,Pisceshave an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive.

Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them.

This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality.

It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap.

The seriousness of an Aries when sex is in question is something that gives Sagittarius a strong impulse to make a joke.\nThese are two Fire signs, both very passionate, each one in their own way. Aries is passionate when it comes to action, new things and of course – naked people and specific sexual positions. Sagittarius is passionate about their cheerful personality. You have to understand that Sagittarius really only cares about their opinions, convictions and moral value. They can spend their entire life analyzing these to see if they are wrong or right and search for the universal truth. When it comes to their optimism and good mood, they passionately protect them from anything too serious or hard. If they let someone taint them, it would shake their conviction that they should always smile and find a reason to be happy.\nAlthough Aries can be a bit vain about their sexual abilities and performance, in most cases Sagittarius is able to break this wall of strict, sexual tension and lead them to a more relaxed zone where they can relax and experiment.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable.

He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain.

In time they will both understand that Aries grows through this relationship and widens their entire system of values. When they started dating, Aries probably had this idea of honor and heroic “sweep off feet” logic. In time, they both must have realized that Sagittarius gives this idea a new step up and brings it into a world of royalty. Not only does Sagittarius value honorable and heroic people, too, but they value honorable people with blue blood that give money and food to the poor, every day.\nTheir main difference is in the fact that Aries values things concise and clear, while Sagittarius will easily disperse and go around the point for days. This can be met through their mutual value of truth, so honesty can be their cure for anything.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life.

Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one.

Virgo values intelligence while Aries thinks success has nothing to do with it and sees it as a possible reason for loneliness and sorrow.

When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often.

It is not easy for them to mend these differences or keep them out of their sex life, because they wouldn’t feel like themselves in a relationship with disregard of their primal needs.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day.

Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

        "text": "Aries and Scorpio are signs with an unbreakable bond. Aries is our first breath, Scorpio is the last. They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

Still, they part ways in their further processing of these\nWhile Aries considers something is done with as soon as it’s cleared, Scorpio will dig for reasons why it would be unclear, or was unclear in the first place. So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

Although they will not agree on many other things, this is the one that could connect them strongly, because they are both such strong individuals in the eyes of each other.Leo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”.

If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit over exaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

Still, they part ways in their further processing of these.\nWhile Aries considers something is done with as soon as it’s cleared, Scorpio will dig for reasons why it would be unclear, or was unclear in the first place. So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

They don’t often find each other right away, but at some point in life it is almost certain that a Gemini will find their Sagittarius and vice versa. Their relationship has a strong intellectual connection, in which they will gradually find deep emotions. There is no real prognosis how this will end though, because the emotions they feel could easily scare them away and their relationship could end only because of fear. If they decide to give in and find out what they could share, with Gemini’s ideas and Sagittarius’ beliefs, the sky is the limit. Or is it beyond?",

When they get together, they usually get strangely involved in emotions none of them really understands. Their sex life is something to cherish, easy, open and with no pressure at any side. They will both enjoy their sexual relations, followed by laughter, creativity and joy. As two children in bodies of grown-ups, they could go through the feeling of shame together if they don't have much experience.\nWhen they meet a bit older, there is a slim chance that both of them didn’t have enough sexual experiences and partners to understand their personal needs and desires. This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.",

As opposing signs it might seem that Gemini is scattered and superficial, while Sagittarius is collected and deep, but in fact they have the same core in the fact that everything needs to make sense. Usually, we would connect this with the sign ofSagittarius, butGeminihas it in their approach to words and everyday actions. Their Mercury can’t deal with senseless words, stories without meaning and purpose, whatever that purpose may be.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\nAs a mutable sign,Pisceshave an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Their sexual relationship is a contact of two powerful individuals, one of them extremely strict and rational, and another flexible and emotional but confident about their beliefs. Differences between them will create a strong attraction, almost as if they were opposing signs.The sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed. But in a different way than a Cancer, Pisces can reach emotional depth of Capricorn by a simple feel. This is not a matter of compassion, but a matter of their deep inner truths. Capricorn isn’t unemotional, however obvious their coldness might be, and Pisces can be quite rational, even though they seem lost in emotion. They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\nThe sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed.

They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\nTheir sex life will move in a strangely spontaneous way.

Capricorn will feel more casual and Pisces will start to gather themselves up. If they stay together for long enough, they could make a perfect blend of stability, trust and emotional excitement.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

Capricorn will surprisingly value one’s ability to be in touch with their emotions and have a clear vision of a positive outcome.\nUnfortunately, they will have a real problem in approaching the use of beliefs and emotions in everyday life, and while Capricorn will value coolheaded thinking and one’s ability to be rational, Pisces will value the opposite.

It won't be easy but they might value each other enough to overcome their differences.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control.

Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.\nBe as creative as possible.

Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most.

Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments.

It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.Aquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges.

This doesn’t mean they will find the same people, actions or thoughts intelligent and they could often have opposite opinions on someone in their surroundings. Still, they could motivate each other to develop their intellectual strengths and hold on to this asset if other things in their relationship aren’t that good. Other things they value aren’t really similar and while Virgo would always choose practicality, Aquarius would choose the unknown and a not so understandable reality.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Leo is a passionate lover, warm, always in search for action and they can be quite casual when it comes to their sexual encounters. Scorpio is sex itself, and the depth of emotion that goes with it in its purest form. When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions. What Leo sees as love, Scorpio finds superficial and irritating, and what Scorpio sees as love,Leofinds depressing and irritating. They both need to give up control entirely if they want to find sexual satisfaction with each other.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

Although they understand clarity in different directions and depth, the main characteristics in people they wish to date are very similar. Often, they won’t even recognize their similarity out of an emotionally unstable or obsessively stable position, completely different from a passionate, creative one. They have to deal with the value of creation against the value of destruction and this is not easily reconciled. The bridge between them is found in unconditional honesty.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy.

Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.\nThe best possible scenario for their relationship would be for them to get to know each other very well and build a friendship without expectations, for years.

With their childish attitude that changes with the weather, there seems to be no room for any sexual activity in their life. Although this is a delusion, these signs are too far apart in their basic character to understand each other’s sexuality. Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.",

They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for opinions of other people, so representatives of this sing go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality. They will either be afraid to be judged and seem too asexual, or have a need to show it “in spite” of everyone’s opinion and this can be quite repulsive for their partner. When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels.

Sagittarius is a mutable sign, making both of them change with the slightest glimpse of a problem, and while they are satisfied with the unrestrained, liberating experience, they will remain as intimate as their minds allow them to.\nThe problem they might have to deal with is the lack of emotion and depth in their contact. Sagittarius is not often superficial, but when with another Sagittarius, their minds throw them in all sorts of different directions and there is not much room for genuine emotion. They can be madly in love, but still lack consistency in their emotional contact. This will influence their sex life and make it as changeable as they both are.

She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it.

Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance.

He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\nVirgois a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.",

With Taurus’ ruler in fall at the sign of Virgo, their Earth to Earth understanding is a bit damaged. Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

There is nothing in the world that is as exciting as conversations that are so intense and so challenging for their minds. Most of the time they will agree on things they value most, although they might stumble upon a huge problem when they get to the point of throwing out the trash. Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo. Just imagine as their first child is born and Scorpio wants to frame that dried out residue of an umbilical cord. Do you think Virgo would want to wake up to this in their apartment every morning?\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

It is pointless to look for peace, when the opposite of peace is what attracts them in the first place.

They have similar sexual preferences and they definitely take each other seriously, whatever the level of their relationship. As they both have extremely strong personalities, they could fight and make up all the time, but enjoy it in a way some Water signs might find crazy.\nThey have a sexual connection that cannot be interrupted, changed or faded through time, since they are both individual sources of energy, waiting for someone to follow. Still, if one of them has issues with their ego, they could slump into an energy drain system, where they insult each other and destroy each other’s confidence and libido. This is a very rare possibility, but it is always there when two signs that present an extraordinary soil for the Sun come together.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed.

Anything concise needs strong Mars energy, the ruler of Aries, while Leo brings clarity to all. Their only problem is the need they both have to be the leader and the brave one in the relationship. It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead. This can come between them and manifest as a typical battle of the sexes (in case they are of the opposite sex) or as a fight for dominance of any kind, consuming the quality of their relationship only because of their need to be the one with dominant values in general.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up.

If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you.

If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality. Leo could be the right partner to teach them how to make a real intimate connection if they are not preoccupied with themselves. They will both want to experiment, have sexual encounters outdoors and will enjoy being naked. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to overcome shame and any sort of fear regarding intimacy and sexuality.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe.

The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of.

There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being.

She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship.

There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

        "text": "Most of all, they both value life and peace. Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

Pisces partner understands the necessity of lies, but still lives for clarity of the mind and the realization of their true inner Self. A great link between their worlds of values is in Leo’s heroic nature that seems to have roots in a fairytale of Pisces. As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Although they will not agree on many other things, this is the one that could connect them strongly, because they are both such strong individuals in the eyes of each other.Leo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing?

She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

Even when they are attracted to each other and form a sexual bond, after their time has passed they will probably feel like they shouldn’t have been together. There is no logical explanation to this feeling, but it is present more often than not. Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to. In the beginning of their relationship, if they share the same desires, they might not see how incompatible they actually are. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul. Their meeting point is in the sing opposing Capricorn, where the ruler of Sagittarius is exalted. In other words, their meeting point is in pure emotion.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Sagittarius is a mental sign, focused on philosophy and learning, always in search for unity, synthesis and that universal truth. Capricorn is the logical continuance of Sagittarius, as a practical tool that uses knowledge. If they don’t find each other stupid, they will click in the same wavelength without much trouble, and discover that they share a certain depth and curiosity that isn’t obvious at first glance. Still, most of their values differ greatly and their needs are often too far off. While one of them values freedom, width and creativity, the other values practicality, responsibility and focus.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy.

Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two.

Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful.

In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them.

She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

When they find an emotional link, they can go very deep in search of true love, and unite on a level that is unreachable for other zodiac signs. This can make them speak without words, understand each other’s thoughts with only one shared glance and be synchronized in their approach to their future together.\nIf their emotions aren’t shared on a deepest possible level, or Scorpio partner refuses to deal with them, it could be too hard for Cancer to handle the self-destructive nature of their partner. Their connection needs to be sincere and pure, in order for both of them to be ready to give in to this intense emotional contact.",

Cancer can usually understand the need of their Scorpio partner to express their deepest, darkest emotions in their sex life. If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any. When they fall in love, they will both need to express their feelings and the intimacy they might share is incredible.\nHowever,Scorpiois a sign in which the Moon falls and this is the ruler of the sign ofCancer. If Scorpio’s need to bury their emotions is too intense, there is a great chance they will be too rough or insensitive on their partner. This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

It can be difficult for these partners to coordinate their personalities if they are both not flexible enough to understand their differences and the depth each of them has behind these superficial needs. Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values.\nIf Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point.

Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship.

Other things they value aren’t really similar and while Virgo would always choose practicality, Aquarius would choose the unknown and a not so understandable reality.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful.

If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

This is not a consequence of a lack of initiative, but rather their own need to stay in the bubble of emotional perfection and their fear of bursting this bubble by forming a physical relationship that requires dealing with physical imperfections.\nWhen they begin a physical relationship, they could both be too cautious on choices of sexual activity they will suggest to each other.

They will both value talent, one’s ability to stay true, and the flexibility someone has in the outer world. However, two Pisces partners might realize that they don’t share the same values when they are together. The problem here is in the fact that they are too alike and they will wake each other’s deficiencies through mere existence. This will lead to misunderstandings and the conviction of both partners that they don’t value the same things. Not because their values differ that much, but because their priorities might be different.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner.

Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere.

Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man.

Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

This doesn’t mean they won’t enjoy the trouble of being together, or stay in a relationship for a very long time, but this is most certainly not a bond that many other signs would engage in. Their biggest challenge is the lack of respect for emotional value that is usually initiated by Capricorn, but easily continued by Libra. If they find a way to share, show and understand each other’s emotions, everything else will seem like a piece of cake.",

Ruled by Venus and Saturn, they tell the tale of a soldier that had to leave his wife and came back after years of waiting. When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

        "text": "The most important values Libra and Capricorn share are the value of time and taking responsibility. This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world. This is a good training for a Libra partner to find grounding, but it usually won’t be pleasant for any of them in a romantic relationship.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

They have a possibility to become an inspirational contact of heart and mind, if only they give in to the opportunity to enter each other’s worlds.\nTheir sexual relationship seems to be a lecture on emotion. The sign ofVirgobrings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.",

To Virgo, their Cancer partner will seem much more down to earth and rational than they are, and to Cancer, their Virgo partner will have a recognized soft spot in their heart. Other things won’t matter much when they find each other, because there is no compromise they both wouldn’t make to keep this love going. However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship. As a deeply emotional and the most intelligent sign in the zodiac, one of them values family, love and understanding, and the other intellect, attention to detail and their health. It is not like they don’t have a meeting point, but it will not be easily found if they both stubbornly keep to their habits and opinions.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people.

When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

On the other hand, Sagittarius will make things light, fun and although the lack of depth could bother Cancer, passion and warmth they bring into their sex life might just be enough to compensate.\nThe only way their relationship can succeed is for Cancer to let go of their preconceptions and allows some change and fun enter their strict sex zone. Although they can seem mellow most of the time, they have a tendency to hold on to secure patterns when it comes to things that can make them feel shame or insecurity. In return, Sagittarius will have to lower their expectations on Cancer’s own changeability and sexual creativity, and be satisfied with lovemaking instead of a sexual adventure.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level.

If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you.

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

But we can also see two people who hold on to their restrictions, who deny themselves the right for satisfaction and choose to make rational decisions every single day. Practicality doesn’t go well with sexuality, and while other partners can awake their sexual creativity and form an intimate bond with them, two Capricorn partners will rarely satisfy each other in a sexual and an emotional sense combined.\nOn top of this, there is a fact that their sign is a ruler of time itself, and the most probable outcome of their contact is an endless wait for anything to happen. None of them lacks initiative as they do both exalt Mars, but when it comes to taboos and matters of the flesh, two Capricorn partners can’t seem to get to the point in which they actually take their clothes off. When they start a sexual relationship, they could go to one of two extremes. Either they will fully understand each other’s needs with very few words, or they will just hit the wall every time any partner wishes to create a more intimate atmosphere.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

The rigid nature of Capricorn doesn’t allow much understanding when it comes to behavior that “isn’t approved” and being a Capricorn doesn’t exclude anyone from the primal equations each of them sets. They should stick to the values they share instead of questioning those they don’t.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it.

However, this affects them in different ways, for Gemini is a masculine sign, always ready to explore, whileVirgois a feminine sign, shy and sensitive. Their sexual relationship is hardly promising, but they both have the need to communicate. If they find a language they both understand, they might agree on the way their sexual life is to progress. However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves. To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

However, they do value rationality, someone’s ability to reason and one’s practical use of their hands and their brain.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe.

On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people. So although they value the same thing – courage, they see it through different eyes.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish.

This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction.

We can see two partners that exalt Mars, meaning their libidos are strong and they have the need to follow their instincts. But we can also see two people who hold on to their restrictions, who deny themselves the right for satisfaction and choose to make rational decisions every single day. Practicality doesn’t go well with sexuality, and while other partners can awake their sexual creativity and form an intimate bond with them, two Capricorn partners will rarely satisfy each other in a sexual and an emotional sense combined.\nOn top of this, there is a fact that their sign is a ruler of time itself, and the most probable outcome of their contact is an endless wait for anything to happen. None of them lacks initiative as they do both exalt Mars, but when it comes to taboos and matters of the flesh, two Capricorn partners can’t seem to get to the point in which they actually take their clothes off. When they start a sexual relationship, they could go to one of two extremes. Either they will fully understand each other’s needs with very few words, or they will just hit the wall every time any partner wishes to create a more intimate atmosphere.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

They seem to know how to make everything a little less serious and this will help their Libra partner open up and share their emotions through sex, too. When Gemini partner sees how mellow Libra can be, although they seem so tactful and cold, they won’t have much choice but to share emotions as well.\nThe main goal in their sexual life is, in fact, to balance these emotions.Librais a sign ruled by Venus, sexual, sensual and seductive, while Gemini is ruled by Mercury, having no sexual or emotional wisdom. The basis of a good sex life between them is their curiosity, for Libra is always curious about their partner, as much as Gemini is curious about everything else. Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship.

They could find a way to tease each other with words, seduce each other and in the end find a way to communicate everything else – in case they both care enough.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad.

It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman.

Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic.

This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.",

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

Leo is a passionate lover, warm, always in search for action and they can be quite casual when it comes to their sexual encounters. Scorpio is sex itself, and the depth of emotion that goes with it in its purest form. When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions. What Leo sees as love, Scorpio finds superficial and irritating, and what Scorpio sees as love,Leofinds depressing and irritating. They both need to give up control entirely if they want to find sexual satisfaction with each other.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

Although they understand clarity in different directions and depth, the main characteristics in people they wish to date are very similar. Often, they won’t even recognize their similarity out of an emotionally unstable or obsessively stable position, completely different from a passionate, creative one. They have to deal with the value of creation against the value of destruction and this is not easily reconciled. The bridge between them is found in unconditional honesty.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use.

However, they could find themselves in a relationship that doesn’t have enough emotion and compassion, and this is certain to surface as soon as the first disturbing thing happens in the life of one of these partners.

They don’t need to get naked to have a sexual experience, although they will want to be naked all the time to set themselves free from all the human restrictions represented through clothes. They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia.

Virgo is an Earth sign ruled by Mercury, relying highly on their intellect, while bringing Venus to its fall. Libra is an Air sign ruled by Venus, and couldn’t be more distant from Virgo’s shy nature or practicality when it comes to sex. They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

It is a strange deceit that comes between them, as if they were both able to practice something entirely out of their reach. The guilt they will subconsciously feel for dismissing each other’s (and their own) emotions will take out the satisfaction between them and leave them in the state of wonder – how can two people that value so many similar things, value something entirely different by the end of the relationship?\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light.

Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

Virgo is an Earth sign ruled by Mercury, relying highly on their intellect, while bringing Venus to its fall.

They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap.

Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

They don’t often find each other right away, but at some point in life it is almost certain that a Gemini will find their Sagittarius and vice versa. Their relationship has a strong intellectual connection, in which they will gradually find deep emotions. There is no real prognosis how this will end though, because the emotions they feel could easily scare them away and their relationship could end only because of fear.

When they get together, they usually get strangely involved in emotions none of them really understands. Their sex life is something to cherish, easy, open and with no pressure at any side. They will both enjoy their sexual relations, followed by laughter, creativity and joy. As two children in bodies of grown-ups, they could go through the feeling of shame together if they don't have much experience.\nWhen they meet a bit older, there is a slim chance that both of them didn’t have enough sexual experiences and partners to understand their personal needs and desires. This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

As opposing signs it might seem that Gemini is scattered and superficial, while Sagittarius is collected and deep, but in fact they have the same core in the fact that everything needs to make sense. Usually, we would connect this with the sign ofSagittarius, butGeminihas it in their approach to words and everyday actions. Their Mercury can’t deal with senseless words, stories without meaning and purpose, whatever that purpose may be.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.Sagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face.

Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality.\nCancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

Their similarity comes to focus right here, where they are free to value emotional clarity, peace and a calm, family life someone is able to create. This could keep them together in a loving relationship even if they maybe didn’t seem perfect for each other in the first place.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction.

It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained.

It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that.

He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile.

It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with.

Ruled by Venus and Saturn, they tell the tale of a soldier that had to leave his wife and came back after years of waiting. When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship.

The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world. This is a good training for a Libra partner to find grounding, but it usually won’t be pleasant for any of them in a romantic relationship.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

        "text": "The biggest difference here is the value Pisces partner gives to emotions, for Sagittarius often doesn’t really understand that approach. If they connect through deep love, they will overcome this with ease and emotions they share will make Sagittarius understand their partner. In general, they will agree on many things. They will value each other’s utopias, people with good hearts, knowledge, wide perspective and travels. They will understand each other’s sense of not belonging and share the sense of a higher power.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her.

If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away.

That might be the only thing you both need.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

The need for conversation with a lot of essence is bigger than any positive or any negative aspects of their relationship and both of them should always have this in mind.

With Aries’ libido and Gemini’s ideas, they might be a bit too creative and harshly judged by their environment. It is a good thing that they both don’t care that much about other’s opinions anyway. In its healthy image, this is mostly a combination of passion, energy and curiosity. In a not so healthy one, their sexual relationship can be full of nasty words and verbal aggression. The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner. Their main goal is to stay as uninhibited as possible, so the Air sign of Gemini can give oxygen to the Fire of Aries.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.",

        "text": "When you calculate the fact that Aries values a person’s ability to be clear and concise, and Gemini’s need to talk around everything, it seems pretty obvious that this is not a perfect match. Now think of Gemini. It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.",

The sign of Pisces is a culmination of a sexual encounter – orgasm. This is a place where Venus is exalted, magical, mysterious and unbelievably satisfying for Taurus’ ruler. They have the ability to get lost in each other, make their dreams come true and satisfy each other by pure existence.\nWhen it comes to sex, Taurus can easily end up in a rut if their partner isn’t inspiring or creative enough. They don’t even care, for as long as their emotional needs are met and their physical body respected. Pisces on the other hand, get lost in sexual experiences, and can even find them toxic if their impressions on other people are unrealistic. When they meet the right Taurus partner, they can be intrigued and relieved by their nature, for what they see is actually what they get.\nBecause of the emotional nature of the sign of Pisces and their deep sense of purpose,Tauruswill feel loved to the point of getting lost in the sexuality of their partner. They will both pay very little attention to their own pleasure because of all those feelings guiding them. This is almost always a giving relationship where both partners are equally satisfied when it comes to sex.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any.

This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves.

This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Ruled by Venus and Saturn, they tell the tale of a soldier that had to leave his wife and came back after years of waiting. When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt.

When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

        "text": "The most important values Libra and Capricorn share are the value of time and taking responsibility. This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world. This is a good training for a Libra partner to find grounding, but it usually won’t be pleasant for any of them in a romantic relationship.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

This could easily lead to a struggle for supremacy and a battle to reach the ruling position among them. This comes as a continuation of Libra’s bruised Sun and a Sagittarius will fit in perfectly with the need to give away every sense of pride out of some childish convictions. The only way for them to be happy together, is to respect each other fully and let each other do what they are meant to do.

They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

Libra doesn’t seem like a creative person to others, but a Sagittarius sees their intellect through communication and motivates them to show their warmth. This leads to shared value of their entire relationship and an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. Even if they don’t start their relationship in the same place, they will have the opportunity to build similar values in time, showing each other what’s truly important.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure.

This is a very interesting couple in the domain of sexual activity – one of them hiding their sexuality, and the other acting as sex itself. Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

There is nothing in the world that is as exciting as conversations that are so intense and so challenging for their minds. Most of the time they will agree on things they value most, although they might stumble upon a huge problem when they get to the point of throwing out the trash. Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo. Just imagine as their first child is born and Scorpio wants to frame that dried out residue of an umbilical cord. Do you think Virgo would want to wake up to this in their apartment every morning?\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship.

Still, they could motivate each other to develop their intellectual strengths and hold on to this asset if other things in their relationship aren’t that good. Other things they value aren’t really similar and while Virgo would always choose practicality, Aquarius would choose the unknown and a not so understandable reality.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces.

If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise.

Although they will most certainly have an abundance of information on sexual activity, only after they have had some experience can they become great lovers. It is very rare for aGeminias an Air sign, to be practical and find the way to manifest what they’ve read or heard about in the realm of reality and physical body. Their biggest quality is the ability to learn. With their desire to become great lovers, they will absorb knowledge through each of their relationship like a sponge.\nTwo Gemini together will share information and coordinate their previous experiences with one another. They will be more satisfied when they teach their partner something, than they will be by sex itself. With their open minds and creative wit, there is probably not a single place they wouldn’t want to have sex with, nor a position they wouldn’t want to try out. It is not like they are promiscuous, but find joy and excitement in the change of scenery, especially if there is relative movement involved, too. So imagine a train, an airplane restroom or any means of transportation in which it is possible to hide.\nHowever, their sexual life can become empty when the excitement has passed if none of them has enough depth to bring into the act of sex. They are not even aware of the focus and emotional connection they need, until they find the right partner. Usually this is not another Gemini. Their hearts should be dug up and their relation to sexuality changed, before they get together with one of their kind. Any other scenario probably won’t keep them satisfied for very long.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did.

She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.",

        "text": "The sexual relationship between a Taurus and a Virgo can be quite touching. Virgo partner is usually ashamed to show their sexuality, or their body for that matter. This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\nVirgois a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.",

With Taurus’ ruler in fall at the sign of Virgo, their Earth to Earth understanding is a bit damaged. Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

Since they touch each other through this sensual, loving planet, they might find true sexual satisfaction together. They can both be selfless lovers, caring more about the satisfaction of their partner than their own.\nTenderness shouldn’t be an issue here for none of these partners will like too much aggression and roughness anyway. They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual. The main issue of speed is usually overcome by the quickly changeable nature of Pisces, except in cases when they are too shy to jump into a sexual relation with someone as openly sexual as Libra.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

This could give them a strong foundation for a sexual relationship if they are attracted to each other in the first place. The rest of their characters will differ greatly and while Libra will value consistency and stability, Pisces will value spontaneity and one’s ability to follow their heart. If they both believe that they have a mission here on Earth, and it happens that their missions cross paths, they could inspire each other to fight for what they value most – their names in the stars.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in.

He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality.

She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift.

The sign of Pisces is a culmination of a sexual encounter – orgasm. This is a place where Venus is exalted, magical, mysterious and unbelievably satisfying for Taurus’ ruler. They have the ability to get lost in each other, make their dreams come true and satisfy each other by pure existence.\nWhen it comes to sex, Taurus can easily end up in a rut if their partner isn’t inspiring or creative enough. They don’t even care, for as long as their emotional needs are met and their physical body respected. Pisces on the other hand, get lost in sexual experiences, and can even find them toxic if their impressions on other people are unrealistic. When they meet the right Taurus partner, they can be intrigued and relieved by their nature, for what they see is actually what they get.\nBecause of the emotional nature of the sign of Pisces and their deep sense of purpose,Tauruswill feel loved to the point of getting lost in the sexuality of their partner. They will both pay very little attention to their own pleasure because of all those feelings guiding them. This is almost always a giving relationship where both partners are equally satisfied when it comes to sex.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter.

However, this affects them in different ways, for Gemini is a masculine sign, always ready to explore, whileVirgois a feminine sign, shy and sensitive. Their sexual relationship is hardly promising, but they both have the need to communicate. If they find a language they both understand, they might agree on the way their sexual life is to progress. However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves. To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

However, they do value rationality, someone’s ability to reason and one’s practical use of their hands and their brain.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

The best thing about their relationship is the positivity both partners share, and a lot of laughter and fun they will share in their sex life.\nUnfortunately, the level of intimacy will rarely be satisfying for any of these partners. Since they are both ruled by Jupiter, they will be faced with their rational natures and their convictions.

She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments.

Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\nAs a mutable sign,Pisceshave an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality.

As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow.

It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self.

If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man.

When one of them starts relying on the masculine nature of their sign, a relationship can begin and the main objective here becomes satisfying one another. Their mental compatibility will allow them to understand each other’s needs and talk about anything regarding their sex life, but their shared lack of confidence might make them judge each other in a way they wouldn’t judge a different partner.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone.

These partners value dedication, a spiritual approach to love, fineness and moderate choices, reasonable behavior that will not be judged by those around them.

His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion.

This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences.

It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

The strength of character they share is something that will give them just the right amount of confidence when it comes to sex, and the creativity and openness of Sagittarius will be refreshing for the fixed nature of Scorpio. However, this often doesn’t last very long and in time, in most cases, Scorpio starts thinking of their Sagittarius partner as unreliable and not to be trusted, while Sagittarius sees Scorpio as dark, pushy and too controlling.\nIn order to remain in a healthy sexual relationship, both of these partners have to compromise, Scorpio finding a way to give freedom, while Sagittarius finding a way not to run away from the seriousness of their partner. In the best possible contact, Scorpio will give their sex life emotion and true physical intimacy, while Sagittarius will be there to give meaning and shake things up, representing the light at the end of a tunnel. Together, they can build an incredible sexual relationship, for both tend to be uninhibited about locations, positions and situations in which they wish to make love.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

They can both feel like outcasts and value each other’s decisions to differ from others out of self-respect. Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths",

It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead. This can come between them and manifest as a typical battle of the sexes (in case they are of the opposite sex) or as a fight for dominance of any kind, consuming the quality of their relationship only because of their need to be the one with dominant values in general.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares.

He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of.

This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed.

We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing?

The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world.

Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point.

He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

It is pointless to look for peace, when the opposite of peace is what attracts them in the first place.

Still, if one of them has issues with their ego, they could slump into an energy drain system, where they insult each other and destroy each other’s confidence and libido. This is a very rare possibility, but it is always there when two signs that present an extraordinary soil for the Sun come together\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe.

Anything concise needs strong Mars energy, the ruler of Aries, while Leo brings clarity to all. Their only problem is the need they both have to be the leader and the brave one in the relationship. It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead. This can come between them and manifest as a typical battle of the sexes (in case they are of the opposite sex) or as a fight for dominance of any kind, consuming the quality of their relationship only because of their need to be the one with dominant values in general.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man.

Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of.

This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.",

Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind.

There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex.

When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Our family is presented by the sign of Cancer and the Moon, and it is a psychological challenge for all of us to understand that our parents are sexual beings. This would be fine if the members of this universal Cancer family weren’t convinced in their asexual nature as well. Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\nThe problem with sexual relations with anAriesis that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

Their values aren’t even connected, except for the fact they both have the idea that some sort of future balance, that can be quite hard to achieve, would make them better.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

In combination with other signs of the zodiac it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.\nThe problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away.\nTheir different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

While Taurus would create and motivate, Capricorn would lead the way to success and financial security. Whatever their goals, they could easily reach them together due to the fact they share the same material values to begin with. Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

In its healthy image, this is mostly a combination of passion, energy and curiosity. In a not so healthy one, their sexual relationship can be full of nasty words and verbal aggression.

It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind.

If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any.

He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

It can be difficult for these partners to coordinate their personalities if they are both not flexible enough to understand their differences and the depth each of them has behind these superficial needs. Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side.

When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Unfortunately, most of the other things they would value in their partner are completely different. While Aquarius values free spirit, communication and independence, Scorpio values commitment, sex and deep emotional connection.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Their relationship can be too stressful for Cancer partner and the lack of intimacy will most probably tear them apart. However, the link between them can actually be wonderful when found, and they could open up such interesting new perspectives for one another if this happens. They both want to learn new things and could travel far if a strong base is made at home, so Cancer can remain peaceful.\nFor this couple to move in a positive direction, Aquarius needs to understand how unusual their partner is, and try to experiment on being homey while having fun. Cancer will have to take over the main set of responsibilities to hold on to the idea of their home as a base from which they can move wherever they want. In the end, Cancer might discover an unbelievable joy of freedom and Aquarius might develop closeness.

AlthoughCanceris considered the most sensitive sign of the zodiac, governed by the Moon, they can be quite rough and distant when they feel the need to set strong boundaries. Aquarius, on the other hand, is known as an innovator, someone to make the change, but in fact, they are a fixed sign, pretty set in their ways and as a paradox – unchangeable.\nWhen they engage in sexual activity, Cancer could be so stressed that they will have to set those boundaries and Aquarius will not be able to make the needed change to be gentler to their Cancer partner. There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

This is a fine connection between their worlds and if it is nurtured it could be just enough for them not to be set apart by other values they hold on to. Cancer does value stability, intimacy and family, while Aquarius values their freedom, intellect and new technology. There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

This is a very interesting couple in the domain of sexual activity – one of them hiding their sexuality, and the other acting as sex itself. Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word.

If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual. The main issue of speed is usually overcome by the quickly changeable nature of Pisces, except in cases when they are too shy to jump into a sexual relation with someone as openly sexual as Libra.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone.

Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken.

This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone.

When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

Still, they part ways in their further processing of these.\nWhile Aries considers something is done with as soon as it’s cleared, Scorpio will dig for reasons why it would be unclear, or was unclear in the first place. So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

AlthoughCanceris considered the most sensitive sign of the zodiac, governed by the Moon, they can be quite rough and distant when they feel the need to set strong boundaries. Aquarius, on the other hand, is known as an innovator, someone to make the change, but in fact, they are a fixed sign, pretty set in their ways and as a paradox – unchangeable.\nWhen they engage in sexual activity, Cancer could be so stressed that they will have to set those boundaries and Aquarius will not be able to make the needed change to be gentler to their Cancer partner. There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic.

The patience Capricorn has for their partner is something Cancer really needs to relax and start feeling sexual to begin with. Capricorn needs someone who acts on true emotion, but also someone who doesn’t take sex lightly. There are Capricorn representatives who have changed many partners, but they will probably never stay with the one that isn’t family oriented and emotional when it comes to physical relations.\nIntimacy Cancer can create is exactly compatible to what Capricorn lacks. There is a lack of love, home and warmth in the sign ofCapricorn, and Cancer partner can heal this with their highly compassionate approach. This could lead to thawing of Capricorn’s emotional state and uplift the state of their sex life significantly.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

They both need stability in their lives and will value people who give them the sense of security. This is probably something they will value most in each other, the ability of both not to quit or give up, however hard things might get.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you.

Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality.

In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point.

        "text": "Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

        "text": "It is truly interesting to watch this couple share values with such a difficult relation to Venus and the term of value itself. Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Still, they could motivate each other to develop their intellectual strengths and hold on to this asset if other things in their relationship aren’t that good. Other things they value aren’t really similar and while Virgo would always choose practicality, Aquarius would choose the unknown and a not so understandable reality.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

There is a strong link between these two signs, and in their sexual relationship, things will most certainly never get boring. At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\nAs a mutable sign,Pisceshave an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality.

The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to?

Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

They have a lot to learn from each other, and the main goal of their relationship is to reach the point of shared respect and responsibility in a perfect balance of power. It will sometimes be hard for them to overcome the need for competing, trying to determine who is a better, smarter or a more capable person.

With Leo’s confidence, and Libra’s sexuality, they tend to inspire each other to become great lovers when together. Their sex life is usually filled with respect, and they feel free to try out new things with one another. If they found their relationship on a strong mutual attraction, they could enjoy a satisfying sex life for a very long time.\nLeo doesn’t mind being seen and Libra is a sign that represents the public eye. Although this says something about their sexual preferences too, they will usually be well behaved in public. As soon as any restrictions show up, they will have to play out their passionate scenarios at any time, and in any place in which they get a chance to be alone if only for a minute. Libra is a sign of Saturn’s exaltation and it is easy for them to wait and be rational, but with passionate Leo they find it hard to stay in control.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

Libra, on the other hand, values justice and one’s ability to be the hero – something they often think they lack. They are finely compatible when it comes to matters of the Sun and they complement each other well in a way that helps them both learn about expressing themselves and their abilities and strengths. The problem with this couple is in their relationship toward Saturn, and while Leo represents its detriment, Libra exalts it. Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

There is a fine way in which Capricorn can help Pisces be more realistic and practical, while feeling more cheerful and optimistic themselves.\nStill, there are challenges in their contact, mainly represented through their love of Jupiter. It might be hard for them to reconcile their different approaches to religion, faith and their different belief systems.

Their sexual relationship is a contact of two powerful individuals, one of them extremely strict and rational, and another flexible and emotional but confident about their beliefs. Differences between them will create a strong attraction, almost as if they were opposing signs.\nThe sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed. But in a different way than a Cancer, Pisces can reach emotional depth of Capricorn by a simple feel. This is not a matter of compassion, but a matter of their deep inner truths. Capricorn isn’t unemotional, however obvious their coldness might be, and Pisces can be quite rational, even though they seem lost in emotion. They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\nTheir sex life will move in a strangely spontaneous way. Capricorn will be inspired to let go and open up to their partner, while Pisces will easily ground their affections and find a way to show them through physical contact. Capricorn will feel more casual and Pisces will start to gather themselves up. If they stay together for long enough, they could make a perfect blend of stability, trust and emotional excitement.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.In a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels.

Capricorn will surprisingly value one’s ability to be in touch with their emotions and have a clear vision of a positive outcome.\nUnfortunately, they will have a real problem in approaching the use of beliefs and emotions in everyday life, and while Capricorn will value coolheaded thinking and one’s ability to be rational, Pisces will value the opposite. They will sometimes be too different, Pisces dreaming of a perfect love, Capricorn knowing it is impossible, Pisces imagining a God with a golden beard, Capricorn believing in this moment, or visiting a church because of tradition rather than belief. It won't be easy but they might value each other enough to overcome their differences.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Their sexual energy and inner tension is something often hard to handle individually, and when they get together, this either multiplies to infinity, or they find an absolute understanding. Usually, we can predict the first option. In general, every Scorpio needs someone to balance them, for they go to extremes of all kinds, and when together, they will rarely have the patience or the tenderness to balance anything, let alone each other.\nTheir sex life is intense, often amazing, although everything around it seems to be falling apart. They will fight to make up, manipulate obviously to make each other angry, and do things out of spite. When we talk about spicing one’s sex life, we have to understand that these two are spices themselves, and there is rarely anything boring about them. In order for their sexual relationship to work out, both partners need to stick to that inner tenderness and emotional closeness when together, or they might have to end things as if torn apart by nuclear energy. The key here is to slow down, breathe in, and spend time in each other’s cozy arms.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

They do value similar things, but they are not entirely rational or realistic in their choices. This makes them susceptible to judging their own reflection in one another.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth.

However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves. To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.",

In fact their relationship can show us exactly how relative intelligence is. Their meeting point is actually in their emotional intelligence, not our typical one. However, they do value rationality, someone’s ability to reason and one’s practical use of their hands and their brain.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

In this relationship, they would have a distant partner that basically supports their primal, instinctive nature.

Their signs go well together in general and they support each other easily, since they both have a lot of energy to follow one another. Still, when it comes to their sexual and intimate relations, they could lack emotion. Aries is a passionate sign with lot of warm, creative emotions. This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries. This is very fun at the beginning of their relationship, but after a while, it might get tiresome for there are not enough ideas to cover the emotional emptiness they could encounter.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

But in time, Aries realizes that they don’t really value freedom that much when they see it at work. In fact, they would often change everything in their lives only to take away the freedom from their Aquarius partner. This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with.

The main problem in their sex life will be their different pace, and this is mostly caused by the difference in their elements.\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn is slow and thorough. A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens.Aquariusis an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship.

It is sometimes easy to forget that the sign of Capricorn precedes Aquarius and that there would be no sense of liberation without enough pressure. Their roles are intertwined in a strange way and they could find themselves valuing the exact same things if they dig into their personalities a bit deeper. To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Both of these partners will have trouble fitting in the usual stereotypes of sexuality and will rarely understand the usual taboos and restrictions other people tend to impose.\nStill, they could find an obstacle in emotional bonding that could present itself through a general lack of intimacy in their sex life. This will not quench the desire they will feel when they are truly attracted to one another, but they could be too detached for any of the partners to give enough warmth or focus to their relationship. This is why as soon as the first excitement and attraction start to fade, and the need for true emotional contact emerges, they might have trouble staying together.\nHowever, if they are both looking for an occasional fling, this might be the best contact of signs in the entire zodiac to have one. There will be no better understanding for the sense of freedom and the need for the lack of intimacy as these two might have in certain conditions. Unfortunately, this is usually not enough to support their future together and they will both probably need someone they could love more and who would care about them in a different way.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

They seem to know how to make everything a little less serious and this will help their Libra partner open up and share their emotions through sex, too.

Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

They are both usually positive enough to have a superficial enjoyable relationship and go well together at large social gatherings. They could both forget to call each other when they agreed to, and they can both change their opinions in two seconds, but they simply don’t share the same goals. As a strongly mental and a strongly emotional sign, their lack of understanding can be hurtful for Pisces and sometimes for both of them. If they do fall in love and start a romantic relationship, chances are they will not last very long.\nHowever, there is a beauty in the creative side of this relationship and if Gemini decides to truly listen to Pisces, they could help them use their talent in a constructive way. In most situations Pisces will just drain the energy out of their Gemini partner, especially if they end up in their fragile, needy mode that some other signs could understand much better than Gemini. If they are to succeed in their persistence to be together, they should work together and socialize a lot. The most important thing for both of them in this relationship is to reach for their emotional cores and give in to true intimacy, or they will never manage to communicate.",

They can be attracted to each other due to the fact that they are ruled by Mercury and Jupiter, the same planets that rule their opposing signs. Still, there is a big chance they won’t even recognize each other as sexual beings or keep a distance from each other if they do.\nGemini has a lot of creative potential, but isn’t exactly in search for their one and only true love in order to have sex. Pisces, on the other hand, exalt Venus, and they only want to have sex with the love of their life, unless they’ve been disappointed too many times. If they meet after these numerous disappointments, Gemini will not find Pisces very attractive, for they will no longer have any childish energy or charm.\nIf their sex life is supposed to be functional, both of them will have to find a way to be a bit more grounded than they normally are. Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

Pisces will value their partner’s reliability and trust is very high on their list of priorities.\nStill, there is one thing they will share, hidden in the fact that they both value someone’s ability to create. Even though this comes out of different views on creation, it can bond them in the act of creativity. Pisces would provide talent and inspiration and Gemini their resourcefulness and practicality.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\nLeois a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point.

Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction.

Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now.

She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.",

We can see two partners that exalt Mars, meaning their libidos are strong and they have the need to follow their instincts. But we can also see two people who hold on to their restrictions, who deny themselves the right for satisfaction and choose to make rational decisions every single day. Practicality doesn’t go well with sexuality, and while other partners can awake their sexual creativity and form an intimate bond with them, two Capricorn partners will rarely satisfy each other in a sexual and an emotional sense combined.\nOn top of this, there is a fact that their sign is a ruler of time itself, and the most probable outcome of their contact is an endless wait for anything to happen. None of them lacks initiative as they do both exalt Mars, but when it comes to taboos and matters of the flesh, two Capricorn partners can’t seem to get to the point in which they actually take their clothes off. When they start a sexual relationship, they could go to one of two extremes. Either they will fully understand each other’s needs with very few words, or they will just hit the wall every time any partner wishes to create a more intimate atmosphere.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

It is not easy for one Capricorn to find another Capricorn to share them. The rigid nature of Capricorn doesn’t allow much understanding when it comes to behavior that “isn’t approved” and being a Capricorn doesn’t exclude anyone from the primal equations each of them sets. They should stick to the values they share instead of questioning those they don’t.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being.

This could keep them together in a loving relationship even if they maybe didn’t seem perfect for each other in the first place.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

The strength of character they share is something that will give them just the right amount of confidence when it comes to sex, and the creativity and openness of Sagittarius will be refreshing for the fixed nature of Scorpio. However, this often doesn’t last very long and in time, in most cases, Scorpio starts thinking of their Sagittarius partner as unreliable and not to be trusted, while Sagittarius sees Scorpio as dark, pushy and too controlling.\nIn order to remain in a healthy sexual relationship, both of these partners have to compromise, Scorpio finding a way to give freedom, while Sagittarius finding a way not to run away from the seriousness of their partner. In the best possible contact, Scorpio will give their sex life emotion and true physical intimacy, while Sagittarius will be there to give meaning and shake things up, representing the light at the end of a tunnel. Together, they can build an incredible sexual relationship, for both tend to be uninhibited about locations, positions and situations in which they wish to make love.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable.

Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength.

She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth.

Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

They are both usually positive enough to have a superficial enjoyable relationship and go well together at large social gatherings. They could both forget to call each other when they agreed to, and they can both change their opinions in two seconds, but they simply don’t share the same goals. As a strongly mental and a strongly emotional sign, their lack of understanding can be hurtful for Pisces and sometimes for both of them. If they do fall in love and start a romantic relationship, chances are they will not last very long.\nHowever, there is a beauty in the creative side of this relationship and if Gemini decides to truly listen to Pisces, they could help them use their talent in a constructive way. In most situations Pisces will just drain the energy out of their Gemini partner, especially if they end up in their fragile, needy mode that some other signs could understand much better than Gemini. If they are to succeed in their persistence to be together, they should work together and socialize a lot. The most important thing for both of them in this relationship is to reach for their emotional cores and give in to true intimacy, or they will never manage to communicate.",

They can be attracted to each other due to the fact that they are ruled by Mercury and Jupiter, the same planets that rule their opposing signs. Still, there is a big chance they won’t even recognize each other as sexual beings or keep a distance from each other if they do.\nGemini has a lot of creative potential, but isn’t exactly in search for their one and only true love in order to have sex. Pisces, on the other hand, exalt Venus, and they only want to have sex with the love of their life, unless they’ve been disappointed too many times. If they meet after these numerous disappointments, Gemini will not find Pisces very attractive, for they will no longer have any childish energy or charm.\nIf their sex life is supposed to be functional, both of them will have to find a way to be a bit more grounded than they normally are. Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active.

Pisces will value their partner’s reliability and trust is very high on their list of priorities.\nStill, there is one thing they will share, hidden in the fact that they both value someone’s ability to create. Even though this comes out of different views on creation, it can bond them in the act of creativity. Pisces would provide talent and inspiration and Gemini their resourcefulness and practicality.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man.

Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone.

On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from.

The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing?

The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth.

Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

The main problem of their relationship is in the possible conflict between emotional Cancer and reasonable Virgo. If they manage to overcome this, accepting each other’s shortcomings and learning to incorporate some rationality or some emotion into their lives, they could end up in an inspiring relationship that will last for a very long time. In a way, they complement each other as much as the heart complements the mind.

They have a possibility to become an inspirational contact of heart and mind, if only they give in to the opportunity to enter each other’s worlds.\nTheir sexual relationship seems to be a lecture on emotion. The sign ofVirgobrings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.",

Other things won’t matter much when they find each other, because there is no compromise they both wouldn’t make to keep this love going. However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship. As a deeply emotional and the most intelligent sign in the zodiac, one of them values family, love and understanding, and the other intellect, attention to detail and their health. It is not like they don’t have a meeting point, but it will not be easily found if they both stubbornly keep to their habits and opinions.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

A great link between their worlds of values is in Leo’s heroic nature that seems to have roots in a fairytale of Pisces. As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

They are linked through their animalistic natures, continuing one another, ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.It is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

        "text": "As much as Scorpio values someone’s strength of character and depth, Pisces will value sensitivity and width. Still, their mutual love for a connection with emotions and the depth of their emotional connection, will give them just enough shared values to hold on to. Scorpio is a sign ruled by Mars and there is always a certain admiration for chivalry. Pisces represent all the fairytales in which a prince became a hero and married a beautiful girl. Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

        "text": "Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

        "text": "It is truly interesting to watch this couple share values with such a difficult relation to Venus and the term of value itself. Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions.

This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe.

Still, there is a big chance they won’t even recognize each other as sexual beings or keep a distance from each other if they do.\nGemini has a lot of creative potential, but isn’t exactly in search for their one and only true love in order to have sex. Pisces, on the other hand, exalt Venus, and they only want to have sex with the love of their life, unless they’ve been disappointed too many times. If they meet after these numerous disappointments, Gemini will not find Pisces very attractive, for they will no longer have any childish energy or charm.\nIf their sex life is supposed to be functional, both of them will have to find a way to be a bit more grounded than they normally are. Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

In general, they will both hold on to what they know best and Gemini will value intellectual strength and won’t get very disturbed by dishonesty for as long as their image of a relationship isn’t disturbed. Pisces will value their partner’s reliability and trust is very high on their list of priorities.\nStill, there is one thing they will share, hidden in the fact that they both value someone’s ability to create. Even though this comes out of different views on creation, it can bond them in the act of creativity. Pisces would provide talent and inspiration and Gemini their resourcefulness and practicality.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Since Mars is a planet primarily connected to sex as a means to continuation of the species, it is quite often that two Aries partners lack the ability to satisfy each other in a sensual, Venus way. Mars will stand for satisfaction in the physical sense, but no Venus – no emotion. Hence, there might be a lack of true human interaction in this segment of relationship.

When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point.

He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life.

If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

Gemini values the independence of their partner and their own freedom, and this is exactly what Leo can give them. On the other hand, Leo always values their partner’s inner child and this is exactly what they will get in their Gemini.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

It is sometimes easy to forget that the sign of Capricorn precedes Aquarius and that there would be no sense of liberation without enough pressure. Their roles are intertwined in a strange way and they could find themselves valuing the exact same things if they dig into their personalities a bit deeper. To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

The seriousness of an Aries when sex is in question is something that gives Sagittarius a strong impulse to make a joke.\nThese are two Fire signs, both very passionate, each one in their own way. Aries is passionate when it comes to action, new things and of course – naked people and specific sexual positions. Sagittarius is passionate about their cheerful personality. You have to understand that Sagittarius really only cares about their opinions, convictions and moral value. They can spend their entire life analyzing these to see if they are wrong or right and search for the universal truth. When it comes to their optimism and good mood, they passionately protect them from anything too serious or hard. If they let someone taint them, it would shake their conviction that they should always smile and find a reason to be happy.\nAlthough Aries can be a bit vain about their sexual abilities and performance, in most cases Sagittarius is able to break this wall of strict, sexual tension and lead them to a more relaxed zone where they can relax and experiment.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

In time they will both understand that Aries grows through this relationship and widens their entire system of values. When they started dating, Aries probably had this idea of honor and heroic “sweep off feet” logic. In time, they both must have realized that Sagittarius gives this idea a new step up and brings it into a world of royalty. Not only does Sagittarius value honorable and heroic people, too, but they value honorable people with blue blood that give money and food to the poor, every day.\nTheir main difference is in the fact that Aries values things concise and clear, while Sagittarius will easily disperse and go around the point for days. This can be met through their mutual value of truth, so honesty can be their cure for anything.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

        "text": "Capricorn values boundaries and Aquarius values freedom. So how could they ever possibly be in a loving relationship? It is sometimes easy to forget that the sign of Capricorn precedes Aquarius and that there would be no sense of liberation without enough pressure. Their roles are intertwined in a strange way and they could find themselves valuing the exact same things if they dig into their personalities a bit deeper. To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

When they get together, they usually get strangely involved in emotions none of them really understands. Their sex life is something to cherish, easy, open and with no pressure at any side. They will both enjoy their sexual relations, followed by laughter, creativity and joy. As two children in bodies of grown-ups, they could go through the feeling of shame together if they don't have much experience.\nWhen they meet a bit older, there is a slim chance that both of them didn’t have enough sexual experiences and partners to understand their personal needs and desires. This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

Scorpio is a sign that represents sex, as well as sexual repression, and depending on the upbringing and previous sexual experiences, they can be a bit rough on their sensitive Pisces partner. On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point.

Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God.

Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

However, Aquarius can be very passionate about their humane beliefs and will often support them strongly. This is something Gemini can understand but rarely supports. Because of the fact that Aquarius partner values equality of the people as much as their own freedom, this can be their point of separation, even though Gemini partner does not really disagree.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Both of them are strong individuals, each on their own plane. Their lack of understanding and emotional touch can be explained through the fact that both of them have a mission to spread love to the less fortunate signs of the zodiac. Not everyone is born with an emotional flow like Cancer and a huge, warm heart like Leo.

Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.",

Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

Scorpio is a sign that represents sex, as well as sexual repression, and depending on the upbringing and previous sexual experiences, they can be a bit rough on their sensitive Pisces partner. On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

Still, their mutual love for a connection with emotions and the depth of their emotional connection, will give them just enough shared values to hold on to. Scorpio is a sign ruled by Mars and there is always a certain admiration for chivalry. Pisces represent all the fairytales in which a prince became a hero and married a beautiful girl. Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\nVirgois a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls.

It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations.

It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

Together, they can build an incredible sexual relationship, for both tend to be uninhibited about locations, positions and situations in which they wish to make love.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

        "text": "SinceScorpiois the sign of the exaltation of Uranus, and Sagittarius understands this through its third house, they both value freedom and one’s ability to fight for their beliefs. They can both feel like outcasts and value each other’s decisions to differ from others out of self-respect. Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths",

This is not always the case, of course, but it is very rare for a Gemini partner to manage to relax their Cancer and make them join their sexual adventure. Still, there is a link between them, pretty strong for that matter. Cancer continues the sign ofGemini, and in a way their nature is a consequence of endless conversations and rational explanations.\nIf Gemini partner has enough patience to talk to their partner about same things over and over, in time they could build enough intimacy to have a good sex life. In order for this scenario to develop, Cancer needs to talk, too. It will not be enough to say a sentence or two and expect that their Gemini will understand how they feel. If they manage to communicate, Cancer could actually wake the depth of their Gemini, giving them enough support to express their more emotional sexual personality.\nIf they want their relationship to work, their sex life needs to be somewhere in the middle – intimate enough and exciting enough – for both partners to be satisfied.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit over exaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

While Gemini is a rational sign, giving value to all that comes out of their mind, Cancer is an emotional guru, giving value to things their heart beats for. When it comes to relationships, they are probably the most vulnerable to differences in this category, for differences here make their primary goals different. Although they will both be motivated to find love, the way their partner acts in a relationship could be considered “wrong” due to its opposite nature from what each of them values.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion.

With Leo’s confidence, and Libra’s sexuality, they tend to inspire each other to become great lovers when together. Their sex life is usually filled with respect, and they feel free to try out new things with one another. If they found their relationship on a strong mutual attraction, they could enjoy a satisfying sex life for a very long time.\nLeo doesn’t mind being seen and Libra is a sign that represents the public eye. Although this says something about their sexual preferences too, they will usually be well behaved in public. As soon as any restrictions show up, they will have to play out their passionate scenarios at any time, and in any place in which they get a chance to be alone if only for a minute. Libra is a sign of Saturn’s exaltation and it is easy for them to wait and be rational, but with passionate Leo they find it hard to stay in control.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.",

        "text": "Nothing holds greater value for Leo than someone’s strong personality and their own pride and heroism. Libra, on the other hand, values justice and one’s ability to be the hero – something they often think they lack. They are finely compatible when it comes to matters of the Sun and they complement each other well in a way that helps them both learn about expressing themselves and their abilities and strengths. The problem with this couple is in their relationship toward Saturn, and while Leo represents its detriment, Libra exalts it. Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

Their biggest problem lies in the fact that they give priority to different types of love in their life. If passion and sensual, sexual love isn’t there, Pisces will rarely be satisfied with the love they get from their family, and Cancer would find a life without a family nest very depressing.

Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality.\nCancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

As much as they will both value being loved and cared for,Cancerwill value a stable emotional situation and a cozy home to come to, while Pisces will probably value any chance for an emotional rollercoaster more. It is often said that Pisces idealize partners and different things in life, but in fact they get depressed when there is no magic and perfect beauty surrounding them. If their day to day life with a Cancer partner becomes anything similar to a boring routine, they will find a way to run off, find a lover or create any sort of truly exciting circumstances.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Scorpio is a sign that represents sex, as well as sexual repression, and depending on the upbringing and previous sexual experiences, they can be a bit rough on their sensitive Pisces partner. On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome.

Still, their mutual love for a connection with emotions and the depth of their emotional connection, will give them just enough shared values to hold on to. Scorpio is a sign ruled by Mars and there is always a certain admiration for chivalry. Pisces represent all the fairytales in which a prince became a hero and married a beautiful girl. Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere.

Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God.

Their connection is like a “little death” making room for all that is new, untamed and inexperienced. It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

When they get involved, trust becomes something like a sole purpose of their entire relationship.\nThey will also both like fairytale heroes and value the usual pride, chastity and bravery scenario. Still, the core of these values is different for the two of them. Aries representatives will value them because of that sense of strength, power and because of the role of that one and only hero, smarter and braver than everyone else. Pisces value them for their ideals, happy endings and those utopian relationships between those few worthy men and women.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus.

The main problem in their sex life will be their different pace, and this is mostly caused by the difference in their elements.\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn is slow and thorough. A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens.Aquariusis an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

It is sometimes easy to forget that the sign of Capricorn precedes Aquarius and that there would be no sense of liberation without enough pressure. Their roles are intertwined in a strange way and they could find themselves valuing the exact same things if they dig into their personalities a bit deeper. To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

In this relationship, they would have a distant partner that basically supports their primal, instinctive nature.

Still, when it comes to their sexual and intimate relations, they could lack emotion. Aries is a passionate sign with lot of warm, creative emotions. This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries. This is very fun at the beginning of their relationship, but after a while, it might get tiresome for there are not enough ideas to cover the emotional emptiness they could encounter.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors.

But in time, Aries realizes that they don’t really value freedom that much when they see it at work. In fact, they would often change everything in their lives only to take away the freedom from their Aquarius partner. This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed.

The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

The sign of Pisces is a culmination of a sexual encounter – orgasm. This is a place where Venus is exalted, magical, mysterious and unbelievably satisfying for Taurus’ ruler. They have the ability to get lost in each other, make their dreams come true and satisfy each other by pure existence.\nWhen it comes to sex, Taurus can easily end up in a rut if their partner isn’t inspiring or creative enough. They don’t even care, for as long as their emotional needs are met and their physical body respected. Pisces on the other hand, get lost in sexual experiences, and can even find them toxic if their impressions on other people are unrealistic. When they meet the right Taurus partner, they can be intrigued and relieved by their nature, for what they see is actually what they get.\nBecause of the emotional nature of the sign of Pisces and their deep sense of purpose,Tauruswill feel loved to the point of getting lost in the sexuality of their partner. They will both pay very little attention to their own pleasure because of all those feelings guiding them. This is almost always a giving relationship where both partners are equally satisfied when it comes to sex.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Their sexual energy and inner tension is something often hard to handle individually, and when they get together, this either multiplies to infinity, or they find an absolute understanding. Usually, we can predict the first option. In general, every Scorpio needs someone to balance them, for they go to extremes of all kinds, and when together, they will rarely have the patience or the tenderness to balance anything, let alone each other.Their sex life is intense, often amazing, although everything around it seems to be falling apart. They will fight to make up, manipulate obviously to make each other angry, and do things out of spite. When we talk about spicing one’s sex life, we have to understand that these two are spices themselves, and there is rarely anything boring about them. In order for their sexual relationship to work out, both partners need to stick to that inner tenderness and emotional closeness when together, or they might have to end things as if torn apart by nuclear energy. The key here is to slow down, breathe in, and spend time in each other’s cozy arms.\nTheir sex life is intense, often amazing, although everything around it seems to be falling apart.

The key here is to slow down, breathe in, and spend time in each other’s cozy arms.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

They will value rationality and emotional maturity, but those are things none of them can actually deliver all the time. They belong to the element of Water and are deeply emotional, while valuing each other’s lack of emotion, shown at the beginning of their relationship. They do value similar things, but they are not entirely rational or realistic in their choices. This makes them susceptible to judging their own reflection in one another.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

The image that comes to mind could easily be the image of two people with split personalities, trying to have sex by banging their heads together and talking at the same time. Although they will most certainly have an abundance of information on sexual activity, only after they have had some experience can they become great lovers. It is very rare for aGeminias an Air sign, to be practical and find the way to manifest what they’ve read or heard about in the realm of reality and physical body. Their biggest quality is the ability to learn. With their desire to become great lovers, they will absorb knowledge through each of their relationship like a sponge.\nTwo Gemini together will share information and coordinate their previous experiences with one another. They will be more satisfied when they teach their partner something, than they will be by sex itself. With their open minds and creative wit, there is probably not a single place they wouldn’t want to have sex with, nor a position they wouldn’t want to try out. It is not like they are promiscuous, but find joy and excitement in the change of scenery, especially if there is relative movement involved, too. So imagine a train, an airplane restroom or any means of transportation in which it is possible to hide.\nHowever, their sexual life can become empty when the excitement has passed if none of them has enough depth to bring into the act of sex. They are not even aware of the focus and emotional connection they need, until they find the right partner. Usually this is not another Gemini. Their hearts should be dug up and their relation to sexuality changed, before they get together with one of their kind. Any other scenario probably won’t keep them satisfied for very long.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.",

Aries is passionate when it comes to action, new things and of course – naked people and specific sexual positions. Sagittarius is passionate about their cheerful personality. You have to understand that Sagittarius really only cares about their opinions, convictions and moral value. They can spend their entire life analyzing these to see if they are wrong or right and search for the universal truth. When it comes to their optimism and good mood, they passionately protect them from anything too serious or hard. If they let someone taint them, it would shake their conviction that they should always smile and find a reason to be happy.\nAlthough Aries can be a bit vain about their sexual abilities and performance, in most cases Sagittarius is able to break this wall of strict, sexual tension and lead them to a more relaxed zone where they can relax and experiment.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments.

Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it.

        "text": "Taurus and Leo have different views on value itself. While Taurus values financial security and material beauty, Leo values everything shiny, bravery and someone’s inner fire. There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

In general, there is a problem that these partners share when it comes to Venus, and their relationship is often a reflection of these troubles. This can lead to all sorts of emotional blackmail, their tendency to control each other’s lives, and if not this, than constant criticism that makes them both feel guilty or simply sad. The best thing they can do is decide that they will value each other and be thankful for each other in this relationship. If they develop a strong sense of gratitude, their relationship might be extremely deep, exciting and truly appreciated by both partners.",

        "text": "If there is something Scorpio would like to fight for, it is the chastity of Virgo. This is a very interesting couple in the domain of sexual activity – one of them hiding their sexuality, and the other acting as sex itself. Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

There is nothing in the world that is as exciting as conversations that are so intense and so challenging for their minds. Most of the time they will agree on things they value most, although they might stumble upon a huge problem when they get to the point of throwing out the trash. Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo. Just imagine as their first child is born and Scorpio wants to frame that dried out residue of an umbilical cord. Do you think Virgo would want to wake up to this in their apartment every morning?\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

Still, the shy nature of Virgo and their caution when it comes to choosing a sexual partner might make it difficult for them to find a language they both understand. Leo wants to be with a partner that makes them feel special and even more confident than they already are, and this is hard for Virgo to give. Their relationship can be quite challenging because the passionate nature of Leo doesn’t give much space to Virgo to feel protected and secure about their choices.

Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by.

This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them.

This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life.

We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship.

However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn't sound promising, does it?\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side.

His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

Leo is not much of a plan maker, they would rather go with the flow and look only a couple of days in advance, and they respect Capricorn’s ability to focus on the final destination and weigh every step of the way. Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship.

These partners value dedication, a spiritual approach to love, fineness and moderate choices, reasonable behavior that will not be judged by those around them. When it comes to this side of their relationship, two Libra representatives seem to be a perfect fit.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign.

This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful.

It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap.

Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction.

This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed.

He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point.

Even when they are attracted to each other and form a sexual bond, after their time has passed they will probably feel like they shouldn’t have been together. There is no logical explanation to this feeling, but it is present more often than not. Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to. In the beginning of their relationship, if they share the same desires, they might not see how incompatible they actually are. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul. Their meeting point is in the sing opposing Capricorn, where the ruler of Sagittarius is exalted. In other words, their meeting point is in pure emotion.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

Sagittarius is a mental sign, focused on philosophy and learning, always in search for unity, synthesis and that universal truth. Capricorn is the logical continuance of Sagittarius, as a practical tool that uses knowledge. If they don’t find each other stupid, they will click in the same wavelength without much trouble, and discover that they share a certain depth and curiosity that isn’t obvious at first glance. Still, most of their values differ greatly and their needs are often too far off. While one of them values freedom, width and creativity, the other values practicality, responsibility and focus.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

They are linked through their animalistic natures, continuing one another, ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\nVirgois a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something.

Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe.

If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

Cancer wants someone responsible, to take them by the hand if needed and complement their emotional nature with practicality. Libra wants someone who is full of life, energized, strong and full of initiative to follow their ideas. They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens. If they focus on love and worry about earthly things each on their own, Cancer could “compromise” on heavenly love, as much as Libra would like to have a family.",

Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find. However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn't sound promising, does it?\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value.

Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

Even when they are attracted to each other and form a sexual bond, after their time has passed they will probably feel like they shouldn’t have been together. There is no logical explanation to this feeling, but it is present more often than not. Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to. In the beginning of their relationship, if they share the same desires, they might not see how incompatible they actually are. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul.

This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it.

Sagittarius will value Cancers dedication to things they love and their incredible ability for compassion.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

Leo is the king of the entire zodiac, and Aquarius seems to be there to bring down the king and fight for independence. Imagine the attraction and the passion between two such strong individuals, lying on the axis of Sun’s rule and detriment.\nTheir sex life is a struggle, a fight and an incredible experience for both. Liberating and yet warm and passionate, sensual but still interesting. When they find true emotion, Aquarius might actually end up respecting the king. The beauty of their sex life is in things they can learn about their bodies, their confidence and the way they look at the act of sex. Through the struggle of insecurities and forced liberation, these are two partners to form a strong connection by a simple act of gravitation that the Sun has over Uranus.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Although they will not agree on many other things, this is the one that could connect them strongly, because they are both such strong individuals in the eyes of each other.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

In its healthy image, this is mostly a combination of passion, energy and curiosity. In a not so healthy one, their sexual relationship can be full of nasty words and verbal aggression. The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner. Their main goal is to stay as uninhibited as possible, so the Air sign of Gemini can give oxygen to the Fire of Aries.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long.

Now think of Gemini. It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it.

She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.",

Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Ruled by Venus and Saturn, they tell the tale of a soldier that had to leave his wife and came back after years of waiting. When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world. This is a good training for a Libra partner to find grounding, but it usually won’t be pleasant for any of them in a romantic relationship.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.",

Aries and Libra are the couple of the zodiac, as much as any other opposing signs, for they are each other’s seventh house, house of relationships. Even more so if we acknowledge the fact that Libra is the sign of relationships in general. Any problem they might have with each other is something to be worked on, because it shows what their personal problem with any relationship is. When they are madly attracted to each other and fall in love, there is almost nothing that could separate them, no matter the differences.

When they engage in intimate relations, it is expected for all their libido and possible problems with sexual expression to surface. Attraction they feel toward each other is great, but their signs combined present passive-aggressive behavior in general and as a couple they could have a tendency to hurt each other in intimate relations.\nRuled by Mars, Aries is a sign of Saturn’s debilitation and Libra exalts it, so their main issue is the lack of emotion and poor boundaries when it comes to sex. Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.",

This is an interesting observation because the sign of Aries is the sign of Saturn’s debilitation and doesn’t seem to understand the set of values or exact steps that would lead them to their goal. It is almost as if Libra knew the way for Aries to reach their goals by discovering new values in relationship with them.\nIn general, their individual values are different in so many ways, but it is exactly the purpose of their relationship to question them and set them straight. Aries values direct, energized approach and outspoken people. Libra values tact, fineness and prestige. While Aries gives their best to live in the now, Libra examines the past to set distant targets in the future. They have a lot to learn from each other, but if they do, they might just set their mutual values somewhere in the middle.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be.

She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility.

        "text": "Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being.

There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life.

It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year.

Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels.

Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

The main problem with their romantic involvement is the lack of trust, especially if Aries partner gets too attached to Gemini, always fighting for their freedom. The need for conversation with a lot of essence is bigger than any positive or any negative aspects of their relationship and both of them should always have this in mind.

With Aries’ libido and Gemini’s ideas, they might be a bit too creative and harshly judged by their environment. It is a good thing that they both don’t care that much about other’s opinions anyway. In its healthy image, this is mostly a combination of passion, energy and curiosity. In a not so healthy one, their sexual relationship can be full of nasty words and verbal aggression. The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner. Their main goal is to stay as uninhibited as possible, so the Air sign of Gemini can give oxygen to the Fire of Aries.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.",

Now think of Gemini. It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.",

The patience Capricorn has for their partner is something Cancer really needs to relax and start feeling sexual to begin with. Capricorn needs someone who acts on true emotion, but also someone who doesn’t take sex lightly. There are Capricorn representatives who have changed many partners, but they will probably never stay with the one that isn’t family oriented and emotional when it comes to physical relations.\nIntimacy Cancer can create is exactly compatible to what Capricorn lacks. There is a lack of love, home and warmth in the sign ofCapricorn, and Cancer partner can heal this with their highly compassionate approach. This could lead to thawing of Capricorn’s emotional state and uplift the state of their sex life significantly.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

They both need stability in their lives and will value people who give them the sense of security. This is probably something they will value most in each other, the ability of both not to quit or give up, however hard things might get.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

If one of them is the best at an emotional department, the other one can be the best in the sexual one. If they split their rules this way, it will be much easier for both of them to function and think of each other as worthy of the relationship.

Leo’s warm nature and passionate approach to all things in life, including sex, will keep them satisfied together for a long time. However, there is a face behind the act to both of these partners that they might be too proud to show. They usually search for partners that can help them show their core in order to really connect instead of simply having sex as an instinctive act.\nThe main problem that two Leo partners can have are their boundaries and the possible lack of respect they have for each other. While they would both enjoy being with someone who is so confident, they might hold on to the image of confidence for way too long, until all sorts of insecurities surface. It is difficult to develop closeness with all that fire in one place and when you think about it, there is only one Sun in our Solar system and everything revolves around it. Then what do you think, can it be possible to have two of them in one bed, circling around each other?\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

It is safe to presume that they will value each other because of these primary values. What they will both value the most when they are together is their time for rest and their time for play. As if they were real little lions, these two are capable of truly enjoying their leisure time and each weekend could seem like paradise.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet.

They are a combination of Water and Air, of emotion and information, all combined in a strong scent of attraction. If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels.

Their connection is like a “little death” making room for all that is new, untamed and inexperienced. It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else.

He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken.

It is a strange deceit that comes between them, as if they were both able to practice something entirely out of their reach. The guilt they will subconsciously feel for dismissing each other’s (and their own) emotions will take out the satisfaction between them and leave them in the state of wonder – how can two people that value so many similar things, value something entirely different by the end of the relationship?\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

Still, the emotional bond and consequentially the intimacy between them could get weak and strong, on and off, too often for both of them to see each other as perfect partners.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now.

If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner.

This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point.

Capricorn needs joy and relaxation in their life, but Gemini seems like a ball of uncontrollable, superficial opinions heading nowhere.

Then Gemini comes along and starts explaining each position, the interesting overview on Kama Sutra and the beauty of outdoor sex. It is almost unbearable to watch these partners with their completely different philosophies while they try to maneuver their sex life.\nIn order for Capricorn to experiment in sex, their partner needs to manage to really relax them and open their mind. With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

Capricorn values stability, punctuality and plain honesty. Although they will both be dazzled by the independence of their partner, the rest of their worlds rarely coincide that much.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

They value depth and this is something they will find incredibly soothing in one another, for they will both feel like they don’t need to pretend to be shallow anymore. They will both value practicality, grounding, money and rational investments. The main difference they have to resolve here is in the value of Capricorn’s goals, for they might be ready to do too much from Virgo’s point of view, in order to reach them. In return, Capricorn doesn’t understand Virgo’s lack of motivation and their lack of need to claim the leading position.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

They are linked through their animalistic natures, continuing one another, ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself.

They are a combination of Water and Air, of emotion and information, all combined in a strong scent of attraction. If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality.

Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love.

He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most.

They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

        "text": "Venus, their ruler, represents value itself, so we could say that they value same things because of the similarities shown through what their ruler likes or not, but in different ways. Of course they both want true, magical, mystical love with Venus exalted in Pisces, but Taurus values tenderness and touch on their way to get there, while Libra values responsibility and seriousness. However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

However, every positive needs a negative to complete it, and when we really observe, we can notice that often a Taurus and a Sagittarius don’t even get attracted to each other. Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.\nThe best possible scenario for their relationship would be for them to get to know each other very well and build a friendship without expectations, for years. In the end, this could result in deep understanding that would provide them both with enough patience to actually start a relationship that has a future. If not, they can always hold on to beauty in the world. Imagine how wonderful their world of creation could be if they joined their forces of good.",

        "text": "When Taurus thinks of sexuality, Sagittarius is probably the last person on their mind. With their childish attitude that changes with the weather, there seems to be no room for any sexual activity in their life. Although this is a delusion, these signs are too far apart in their basic character to understand each other’s sexuality. Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.",

They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

They are linked through their animalistic natures, continuing one another, ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied.With a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child.

She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in.

However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves.

This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom.

If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed.

While Aquarius values free spirit, communication and independence, Scorpio values commitment, sex and deep emotional connection.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone.

Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to.

Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul.

When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

They discover a pleasure of sex they have never had the opportunity to experience, for they perfectly understand each other’s need for touch and the stimulation of all senses. The sign of Taurus is the most sensual sign of the entire zodiac, that is, when they are not too lazy to discover their sexuality. If they don’t lack in primal sexual drive, they will probably build a strong and gentle sexual relationship, in which both of them will have their needs met.\nThe problem they might encounter is the possibility that none of them will have enough initiative. Still, they are usually stubborn enough to overcome this small obstacle. Since they share sexual fantasies and ideas about intimacy, with enough openness and communication they should be able to overcome any obstacle they stumble upon. That is, if they don’t stubbornly wait for the other person to make the first move. This could make them both wait forever.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.",

This is a sign that represents all value and withholds in itself the price of everything in this world. What a Taurus partner values is primarily someone’s respect toward the value itself. Be it the financial value of any object in their surroundings or the value of being loved, the awareness of it is something they consider imperative for their partner to have.\nTwo Taurus in a relationship value values together and a conflict can arise only if they assign different values to different things. Still, in most cases, they will give enough space to one another to set an individual list of priorities and find a compromise if some things are more valuable to one of them, than to the other.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh.

She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

The sign ofVirgobrings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship.

It is not like they don’t have a meeting point, but it will not be easily found if they both stubbornly keep to their habits and opinions.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time.

He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values.\nIf Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided.

If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

When they start dating, their sexual relationship might come as a surprise for both of them, for they will feel liberated to be exactly who they are with each other. The best thing they could do is use the trine between their Suns and build-up each other’s self-esteem, especially if they have been in demanding or disrespectful relationships prior to theirs.\nThe best thing about their sex life is the passion they share. Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons. They will both enjoy each other in a fiery way and respect each other’s bodies, minds and entire personalities. If they stumble upon one another and love is born, their sex life could represent a perfect connection for both of them.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people.

Their sexual relationship is a contact of two powerful individuals, one of them extremely strict and rational, and another flexible and emotional but confident about their beliefs. Differences between them will create a strong attraction, almost as if they were opposing signs.The sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed. But in a different way than a Cancer, Pisces can reach emotional depth of Capricorn by a simple feel. This is not a matter of compassion, but a matter of their deep inner truths. Capricorn isn’t unemotional, however obvious their coldness might be, and Pisces can be quite rational, even though they seem lost in emotion. They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\nThe sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed.

They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\nTheir sex life will move in a strangely spontaneous way.

Capricorn will feel more casual and Pisces will start to gather themselves up. If they stay together for long enough, they could make a perfect blend of stability, trust and emotional excitement.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

It is strange how someone like Pisces can value stable emotions that much, but they help them to finally rest their mind and their heart when they are in a stable emotional relationship. Capricorn will surprisingly value one’s ability to be in touch with their emotions and have a clear vision of a positive outcome.\nUnfortunately, they will have a real problem in approaching the use of beliefs and emotions in everyday life, and while Capricorn will value coolheaded thinking and one’s ability to be rational, Pisces will value the opposite. They will sometimes be too different, Pisces dreaming of a perfect love, Capricorn knowing it is impossible, Pisces imagining a God with a golden beard, Capricorn believing in this moment, or visiting a church because of tradition rather than belief. It won't be easy but they might value each other enough to overcome their differences.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal.

However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn't sound promising, does it?\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better.

She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion.

We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with.

Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words.

Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word.

If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things.

This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.",

        "text": "This is an area in which they match quite well. Although they seem completely different, their main objectives are pretty much the same. They both value material security, since Aries is ruled by Mars, a planet connected to the fear of existential crisis, and Taurus is an Earth sign, material in their core and very inclined to the financial world. They both cherish character and strength, physical and verbal, and need someone who will not disappoint them as the first impression fades.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.",

Leo will need to make room for more movement and understand what seems to be “flakiness” of their changeable Gemini partner, while Gemini will have to understand that Leo is in fact keeping them together for however long they are meant to last.

They are a very good fit when it comes to sex, for Gemini gives their relationship ideas and excitement, while Leo brings in energy, creativity and love. Their sex life can be stimulated by their intellect and communication, for they both rely on their conscious Self and their mind. If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality. Leo could be the right partner to teach them how to make a real intimate connection if they are not preoccupied with themselves. They will both want to experiment, have sexual encounters outdoors and will enjoy being naked. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to overcome shame and any sort of fear regarding intimacy and sexuality.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.",

On the other hand, Leo always values their partner’s inner child and this is exactly what they will get in their Gemini.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

Since they touch each other through this sensual, loving planet, they might find true sexual satisfaction together. They can both be selfless lovers, caring more about the satisfaction of their partner than their own.\nTenderness shouldn’t be an issue here for none of these partners will like too much aggression and roughness anyway. They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual. The main issue of speed is usually overcome by the quickly changeable nature of Pisces, except in cases when they are too shy to jump into a sexual relation with someone as openly sexual as Libra.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

With Venus at focus, they will both need to be loved and cherish those who know how to show it, hot to enjoy life, food and sex, and how to make their loved ones satisfied. This could give them a strong foundation for a sexual relationship if they are attracted to each other in the first place. The rest of their characters will differ greatly and while Libra will value consistency and stability, Pisces will value spontaneity and one’s ability to follow their heart. If they both believe that they have a mission here on Earth, and it happens that their missions cross paths, they could inspire each other to fight for what they value most – their names in the stars.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable.

He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable.

This leads to shared value of their entire relationship and an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. Even if they don’t start their relationship in the same place, they will have the opportunity to build similar values in time, showing each other what’s truly important.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.It is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed.

However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

However, they could find themselves in a relationship that doesn’t have enough emotion and compassion, and this is certain to surface as soon as the first disturbing thing happens in the life of one of these partners.

They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Because of the fact that Aquarius partner values equality of the people as much as their own freedom, this can be their point of separation, even though Gemini partner does not really disagree.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

Still, the shy nature of Virgo and their caution when it comes to choosing a sexual partner might make it difficult for them to find a language they both understand. Leo wants to be with a partner that makes them feel special and even more confident than they already are, and this is hard for Virgo to give. Their relationship can be quite challenging because the passionate nature of Leo doesn’t give much space to Virgo to feel protected and secure about their choices. Their rationality might turn into an intellectual battle for sexual dominance, that is, if they ever reach the point in which they both want to have sex with each other.\nIt is a good thing thatLeois a fixed sign, so they have a conservative note to them that suits Virgo. Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something.

He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word.

On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac.

The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

        "text": "Virgo and Sagittarius will strangely have similar values based on their mutable quality. This is why they will both treasure someone able to adapt, change and move, which is definitely something they will find in each other as they start their relationship. As highly mental signs, they will also both value clarity of mind and intelligence, in general. Still, their approach to intellectual value is different, and as much asVirgovalues depth and detailed analysis, Sagittarius will value the width of one’s mind. Even though they differ in other things they value greatly, Virgo valuing practicality and Sagittarius vision and focus, there is enough common ground here for both of them to feel good when together.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

        "text": "Cancer and Leo make a very interesting couple due to the fact they are the only signs in the zodiac ruled by the lights in the sky, both of which are not planets – the Sun and the Moon. Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

The image that comes to mind could easily be the image of two people with split personalities, trying to have sex by banging their heads together and talking at the same time. Although they will most certainly have an abundance of information on sexual activity, only after they have had some experience can they become great lovers. It is very rare for aGeminias an Air sign, to be practical and find the way to manifest what they’ve read or heard about in the realm of reality and physical body. Their biggest quality is the ability to learn. With their desire to become great lovers, they will absorb knowledge through each of their relationship like a sponge.\nTwo Gemini together will share information and coordinate their previous experiences with one another. They will be more satisfied when they teach their partner something, than they will be by sex itself. With their open minds and creative wit, there is probably not a single place they wouldn’t want to have sex with, nor a position they wouldn’t want to try out. It is not like they are promiscuous, but find joy and excitement in the change of scenery, especially if there is relative movement involved, too. So imagine a train, an airplane restroom or any means of transportation in which it is possible to hide.\nHowever, their sexual life can become empty when the excitement has passed if none of them has enough depth to bring into the act of sex. They are not even aware of the focus and emotional connection they need, until they find the right partner. Usually this is not another Gemini. Their hearts should be dug up and their relation to sexuality changed, before they get together with one of their kind. Any other scenario probably won’t keep them satisfied for very long.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.",

She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough.

Since they touch each other through this sensual, loving planet, they might find true sexual satisfaction together. They can both be selfless lovers, caring more about the satisfaction of their partner than their own.\nTenderness shouldn’t be an issue here for none of these partners will like too much aggression and roughness anyway. They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual.

Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken.

        "text": "Two Scorpio partners can be a dream come true when it comes to sex, as much as they can be each other’s worst nightmare. Their sexual energy and inner tension is something often hard to handle individually, and when they get together, this either multiplies to infinity, or they find an absolute understanding. Usually, we can predict the first option. In general, every Scorpio needs someone to balance them, for they go to extremes of all kinds, and when together, they will rarely have the patience or the tenderness to balance anything, let alone each other.Their sex life is intense, often amazing, although everything around it seems to be falling apart. They will fight to make up, manipulate obviously to make each other angry, and do things out of spite. When we talk about spicing one’s sex life, we have to understand that these two are spices themselves, and there is rarely anything boring about them. In order for their sexual relationship to work out, both partners need to stick to that inner tenderness and emotional closeness when together, or they might have to end things as if torn apart by nuclear energy. The key here is to slow down, breathe in, and spend time in each other’s cozy arms.\nTheir sex life is intense, often amazing, although everything around it seems to be falling apart.

In order for their sexual relationship to work out, both partners need to stick to that inner tenderness and emotional closeness when together, or they might have to end things as if torn apart by nuclear energy. The key here is to slow down, breathe in, and spend time in each other’s cozy arms.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

        "text": "The problem with things they value is in the illusion of value they both share. They will value rationality and emotional maturity, but those are things none of them can actually deliver all the time. They belong to the element of Water and are deeply emotional, while valuing each other’s lack of emotion, shown at the beginning of their relationship. They do value similar things, but they are not entirely rational or realistic in their choices. This makes them susceptible to judging their own reflection in one another.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

There is a strong link between these two signs, and in their sexual relationship, things will most certainly never get boring. At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\nAs a mutable sign,Pisceshave an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Even when they are attracted to each other and form a sexual bond, after their time has passed they will probably feel like they shouldn’t have been together. There is no logical explanation to this feeling, but it is present more often than not. Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to. In the beginning of their relationship, if they share the same desires, they might not see how incompatible they actually are. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul. Their meeting point is in the sing opposing Capricorn, where the ruler of Sagittarius is exalted. In other words, their meeting point is in pure emotion.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Sagittarius is a mental sign, focused on philosophy and learning, always in search for unity, synthesis and that universal truth. Capricorn is the logical continuance of Sagittarius, as a practical tool that uses knowledge. If they don’t find each other stupid, they will click in the same wavelength without much trouble, and discover that they share a certain depth and curiosity that isn’t obvious at first glance. Still, most of their values differ greatly and their needs are often too far off. While one of them values freedom, width and creativity, the other values practicality, responsibility and focus.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome.

If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.",

There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for opinions of other people, so representatives of this sing go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality. They will either be afraid to be judged and seem too asexual, or have a need to show it “in spite” of everyone’s opinion and this can be quite repulsive for their partner. When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

This could represent a big problem in their relationship, and Libra partner could seem clingy and not at all independent, while Aquarius might seem like an uncontrollable lunatic who would do anything to destroy all relationships in the world. Still, they both value communication and intellectual strengths enough to talk about their needs and desires, and this should help them overcome their differences.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual.

She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most.

Scorpio is a sign that represents sex, as well as sexual repression, and depending on the upbringing and previous sexual experiences, they can be a bit rough on their sensitive Pisces partner. On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

Still, their mutual love for a connection with emotions and the depth of their emotional connection, will give them just enough shared values to hold on to. Scorpio is a sign ruled by Mars and there is always a certain admiration for chivalry. Pisces represent all the fairytales in which a prince became a hero and married a beautiful girl. Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

Their relationship can be too stressful for Cancer partner and the lack of intimacy will most probably tear them apart. However, the link between them can actually be wonderful when found, and they could open up such interesting new perspectives for one another if this happens. They both want to learn new things and could travel far if a strong base is made at home, so Cancer can remain peaceful.\nFor this couple to move in a positive direction, Aquarius needs to understand how unusual their partner is, and try to experiment on being homey while having fun. Cancer will have to take over the main set of responsibilities to hold on to the idea of their home as a base from which they can move wherever they want. In the end, Cancer might discover an unbelievable joy of freedom and Aquarius might develop closeness. If these partners can be silent together, sipping on their morning coffee, this is in most cases the first step to success.\nWhen Cancer man falls in love, all of his insecurities will instantly surface. Cancer men have a tendency to stick to certain rules of behavior and courtship because it makes them feel a bit safer and more secure. What this man often fails to realize is the fact that what he has to show, counts for a lot in a world of relationships, even though society seems to favor something else in a man. He is compassionate and sweet, and should show his emotional side. The right partner will understand this immediately.\nWhen an Aquarius woman falls in love, she will follow her feelings for as long as she is unrestricted and free to be herself. The unconscious fear of losing her personality to other people often makes her vulnerable to any sort of expectations and tries to turn her into something she is not. Still, in almost every Aquarius woman’s life comes a time to “grow up” and realize that a certain amount of love should be enough for her to have a family, raise children and take care of her husband. This is probably the hardest thing for her to do, and a decision like this should be respected and understood as the ultimate act of love, even when it seems entirely rational.",

AlthoughCanceris considered the most sensitive sign of the zodiac, governed by the Moon, they can be quite rough and distant when they feel the need to set strong boundaries. Aquarius, on the other hand, is known as an innovator, someone to make the change, but in fact, they are a fixed sign, pretty set in their ways and as a paradox – unchangeable.\nWhen they engage in sexual activity, Cancer could be so stressed that they will have to set those boundaries and Aquarius will not be able to make the needed change to be gentler to their Cancer partner. There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

This is a fine connection between their worlds and if it is nurtured it could be just enough for them not to be set apart by other values they hold on to. Cancer does value stability, intimacy and family, while Aquarius values their freedom, intellect and new technology. There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

Capricorn needs joy and relaxation in their life, but Gemini seems like a ball of uncontrollable, superficial opinions heading nowhere.

Then Gemini comes along and starts explaining each position, the interesting overview on Kama Sutra and the beauty of outdoor sex. It is almost unbearable to watch these partners with their completely different philosophies while they try to maneuver their sex life.\nIn order for Capricorn to experiment in sex, their partner needs to manage to really relax them and open their mind. With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all.

Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so.

You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do.

When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Even though they don’t lack the patience or the understanding for each other, there always seems to be just that one shred of pure emotion missing in their contact. Very often these partners don’t get to have sex, because they will have more reason not to, than to give in.\nThe beauty of their sex life, when they manage to synchronize, is in the depth both partners are capable of, that directly links to the depth of emotions they will show through the act of sex. Their main goal is to find someone who doesn’t take sex lightly, someone who is not superficial toward them and cherishes them as they should be cherished. There is a certain shyness to both of them, and this is something that will make them go crazy for one another, if they only reach the point behind the rational distance they normally share.\nVirgowill bring enough change to their sex life, as a mutable sign, ready to experiment with someone who is so reliable and respectful. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to relax and try out new things, if they find a way to open up in the beginning.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

They value depth and this is something they will find incredibly soothing in one another, for they will both feel like they don’t need to pretend to be shallow anymore. They will both value practicality, grounding, money and rational investments. The main difference they have to resolve here is in the value of Capricorn’s goals, for they might be ready to do too much from Virgo’s point of view, in order to reach them. In return, Capricorn doesn’t understand Virgo’s lack of motivation and their lack of need to claim the leading position.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any. When they fall in love, they will both need to express their feelings and the intimacy they might share is incredible.\nHowever,Scorpiois a sign in which the Moon falls and this is the ruler of the sign ofCancer. If Scorpio’s need to bury their emotions is too intense, there is a great chance they will be too rough or insensitive on their partner. This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side.

When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man.

Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man.

He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God.

This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.",

Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

Even though Virgo can be quite demanding and critical, especially from the point of view of Sagittarius, their sex life can be satisfying for both. The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable.

As highly mental signs, they will also both value clarity of mind and intelligence, in general. Still, their approach to intellectual value is different, and as much asVirgovalues depth and detailed analysis, Sagittarius will value the width of one’s mind. Even though they differ in other things they value greatly, Virgo valuing practicality and Sagittarius vision and focus, there is enough common ground here for both of them to feel good when together.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man.

Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most.

However, they could really help each other blossom if they opened up for the possibility of unusual sexual encounters.\nIf the tenderness of Taurus is projected on their independent, distant Aquarius partner, their creative and motivating side would awake, giving energy and speed to the productive gentle side of Taurus. Imagine the sex life they could have, different from each other, two outcasts, if they only shared enough respect and emotion.\nThey will rarely get this far, for they seem to be looking for different things in a relationship to begin with. Taurus would like to have a secure, unbreakable partnership and Aquarius wants to be free of any attachment to this world, let alone emotional relationships. It is not easy for them to mend these differences or keep them out of their sex life, because they wouldn’t feel like themselves in a relationship with disregard of their primal needs.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other,",

There is really not much they can do, but accept the differences of their goals and natures, for there is truth and good in both approaches to life. They can find certain things to value together, if they put their minds into creating them through Aquarius field of ideas and Taurus’ practical realizations.If you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy.

His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now.

In return, Scorpio will give their Gemini partner depth and emotional vibe to sex that they have never encountered before.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

Although Scorpio values many other things in someone’s personality, they will be impressed by someone’s intelligence and resourcefulness. Gemini will focus on the same thing, but have a slightly different assessment of someone’s intellect. However, they can agree to have a shared point of same value, although other things they strive for will differ greatly.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

        "text": "The sexual relationship between a Virgo and a Libra just doesn’t seem like a good choice. Virgo is an Earth sign ruled by Mercury, relying highly on their intellect, while bringing Venus to its fall. Libra is an Air sign ruled by Venus, and couldn’t be more distant from Virgo’s shy nature or practicality when it comes to sex. They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

It is a strange deceit that comes between them, as if they were both able to practice something entirely out of their reach. The guilt they will subconsciously feel for dismissing each other’s (and their own) emotions will take out the satisfaction between them and leave them in the state of wonder – how can two people that value so many similar things, value something entirely different by the end of the relationship?\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

When they start dating, their sexual relationship might come as a surprise for both of them, for they will feel liberated to be exactly who they are with each other. The best thing they could do is use the trine between their Suns and build-up each other’s self-esteem, especially if they have been in demanding or disrespectful relationships prior to theirs.\nThe best thing about their sex life is the passion they share. Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons. They will both enjoy each other in a fiery way and respect each other’s bodies, minds and entire personalities. If they stumble upon one another and love is born, their sex life could represent a perfect connection for both of them.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable.

Still, it is not easy to explain to a Leo why it is so good to run away from the world, travel in Greenland alone, and eat bugs somewhere in Asia, except if one wants to show their courage. On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people. So although they value the same thing – courage, they see it through different eyes.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner.

Now think of Gemini. It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided.

She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.",

To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly.

This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected.

This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other.

This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it.

As much as Cancer can reach the depth of their partner’s faith, Sagittarius can widen their partner’s horizons and make them much happier in their approach to the world.

Although they can seem mellow most of the time, they have a tendency to hold on to secure patterns when it comes to things that can make them feel shame or insecurity. In return, Sagittarius will have to lower their expectations on Cancer’s own changeability and sexual creativity, and be satisfied with lovemaking instead of a sexual adventure.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level.

She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year.

He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

However, they could find themselves in a relationship that doesn’t have enough emotion and compassion, and this is certain to surface as soon as the first disturbing thing happens in the life of one of these partners.

They don’t need to get naked to have a sexual experience, although they will want to be naked all the time to set themselves free from all the human restrictions represented through clothes. They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

The main problem in their sex life will be their different pace, and this is mostly caused by the difference in their elements.\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn is slow and thorough. A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens.Aquariusis an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.It is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship.\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex.

He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo.

With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with.

This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment.

This should keep him occupied for a while.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

It is strange how someone like Pisces can value stable emotions that much, but they help them to finally rest their mind and their heart when they are in a stable emotional relationship. Capricorn will surprisingly value one’s ability to be in touch with their emotions and have a clear vision of a positive outcome.\nUnfortunately, they will have a real problem in approaching the use of beliefs and emotions in everyday life, and while Capricorn will value coolheaded thinking and one’s ability to be rational, Pisces will value the opposite. They will sometimes be too different, Pisces dreaming of a perfect love, Capricorn knowing it is impossible, Pisces imagining a God with a golden beard, Capricorn believing in this moment, or visiting a church because of tradition rather than belief. It won't be easy but they might value each other enough to overcome their differences.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down.

Pisces partner understands the necessity of lies, but still lives for clarity of the mind and the realization of their true inner Self. A great link between their worlds of values is in Leo’s heroic nature that seems to have roots in a fairytale of Pisces. As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere.

Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet.

The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come.

We wouldn’t primarily link Taurus to sexuality, but it does represent sensuality and is a sign that governs physical pleasure. Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction. This can become an obsession and even an addiction, but who would give up on the opportunity of such deep intimacy?\nAs signs of fixed quality, when they click, it is impossible to separate them, and no one would want to when you consider the possible vengeance of Scorpio. They represent the basic contact between sexual planets Venus and Mars, while being from the physical and emotional realms as an Earth and a Water sign. They are the signification of a deeply intimate relationship and a very rich sex life, for as long as Scorpio is tender enough and Taurus ready to experiment.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

Although their perspectives differ when it comes to material and emotional values, their core is the same and everything else can be adjusted.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents.

However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

There are many challenges in their way, the biggest being their emotional lack of understanding and their possible lack of respect. Still, when they find a way to show emotions and share them in the same pace and in an understandable way, they could actually have a lot of fun together. Their communication is often exciting and they both have a lot to say to each other, but their rationality may distract them from an actual search for love.

Even though Virgo can be quite demanding and critical, especially from the point of view of Sagittarius, their sex life can be satisfying for both. The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

This is why they will both treasure someone able to adapt, change and move, which is definitely something they will find in each other as they start their relationship. As highly mental signs, they will also both value clarity of mind and intelligence, in general. Still, their approach to intellectual value is different, and as much asVirgovalues depth and detailed analysis, Sagittarius will value the width of one’s mind. Even though they differ in other things they value greatly, Virgo valuing practicality and Sagittarius vision and focus, there is enough common ground here for both of them to feel good when together.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

With Leo’s confidence, and Libra’s sexuality, they tend to inspire each other to become great lovers when together. Their sex life is usually filled with respect, and they feel free to try out new things with one another. If they found their relationship on a strong mutual attraction, they could enjoy a satisfying sex life for a very long time.\nLeo doesn’t mind being seen and Libra is a sign that represents the public eye. Although this says something about their sexual preferences too, they will usually be well behaved in public. As soon as any restrictions show up, they will have to play out their passionate scenarios at any time, and in any place in which they get a chance to be alone if only for a minute. Libra is a sign of Saturn’s exaltation and it is easy for them to wait and be rational, but with passionate Leo they find it hard to stay in control.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.",

Libra, on the other hand, values justice and one’s ability to be the hero – something they often think they lack. They are finely compatible when it comes to matters of the Sun and they complement each other well in a way that helps them both learn about expressing themselves and their abilities and strengths. The problem with this couple is in their relationship toward Saturn, and while Leo represents its detriment, Libra exalts it. Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

Still, the shy nature of Virgo and their caution when it comes to choosing a sexual partner might make it difficult for them to find a language they both understand. Leo wants to be with a partner that makes them feel special and even more confident than they already are, and this is hard for Virgo to give. Their relationship can be quite challenging because the passionate nature of Leo doesn’t give much space to Virgo to feel protected and secure about their choices. Their rationality might turn into an intellectual battle for sexual dominance, that is, if they ever reach the point in which they both want to have sex with each other.\nIt is a good thing thatLeois a fixed sign, so they have a conservative note to them that suits Virgo. Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

If they work together, they might create the exact atmosphere in which anything can be created, but only if they share similar professional interests. Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

Aries is passionate when it comes to action, new things and of course – naked people and specific sexual positions. Sagittarius is passionate about their cheerful personality. You have to understand that Sagittarius really only cares about their opinions, convictions and moral value. They can spend their entire life analyzing these to see if they are wrong or right and search for the universal truth.

He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac.

If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

They will easily idealize each other, think of their relationship as the perfect love, but this infatuation won’t last very long because of their changeable natures.

As two mutable signs, there will be no end to their creativity and changes in positions, scenery and levels of commitment and intimacy. Their sex life will have ups and downs, excitements and disappointments, too many expectations and a lot of surprises. The best thing about their relationship is the positivity both partners share, and a lot of laughter and fun they will share in their sex life.\nUnfortunately, the level of intimacy will rarely be satisfying for any of these partners. Since they are both ruled by Jupiter, they will be faced with their rational natures and their convictions. The main reason why their sexual relationship rarely comes true is overthinking of both partners. Sagittarius will wait for a grand emotion, grand gesture or any sort of passionate initiative from Pisces, while Pisces will wait for all of the pieces of the puzzle to fit in their perfect position. In most cases, neither of these things will happen and they won’t move further from a platonic relationship.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be.

They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life.

He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression.

The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all.

Their Air element combined with the rule of Mercury and its lack of emotion is close to Scorpio’s worst nightmare.Scorpiois a sign of our deepest emotions and as such, linked to the most intimate side of sexuality. When they begin a relationship with Gemini, it probably never crosses their mind that such an asexual person can exist in the world.\nIf they fall in love with each other, there is so much for both of them to learn. Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at. If their mutual respect is at a very high point, Gemini could teach Scorpio that not everything needs to be so fatalistic in their sex life. In return, Scorpio will give their Gemini partner depth and emotional vibe to sex that they have never encountered before.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

Still, when it comes to their sexual and intimate relations, they could lack emotion. Aries is a passionate sign with lot of warm, creative emotions. This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries. This is very fun at the beginning of their relationship, but after a while, it might get tiresome for there are not enough ideas to cover the emotional emptiness they could encounter.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship.

But in time, Aries realizes that they don’t really value freedom that much when they see it at work. In fact, they would often change everything in their lives only to take away the freedom from their Aquarius partner. This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Gemini is so far off from Scorpio’s emotional world that good sex between them seems like something almost impossible to happen. This couple needs to be supported by other positions in their natal charts if they are to stand any chance of lasting in a loving, sexual relationship.\nGemini can be superficial and there is no other sign who knows this better, than Scorpio. Their Air element combined with the rule of Mercury and its lack of emotion is close to Scorpio’s worst nightmare.Scorpiois a sign of our deepest emotions and as such, linked to the most intimate side of sexuality. When they begin a relationship with Gemini, it probably never crosses their mind that such an asexual person can exist in the world.\nIf they fall in love with each other, there is so much for both of them to learn. Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at. If their mutual respect is at a very high point, Gemini could teach Scorpio that not everything needs to be so fatalistic in their sex life. In return, Scorpio will give their Gemini partner depth and emotional vibe to sex that they have never encountered before.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

However, they can agree to have a shared point of same value, although other things they strive for will differ greatly.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens.Aquariusis an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave.

To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people.

When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it.

They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you.

His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

They will easily idealize each other, think of their relationship as the perfect love, but this infatuation won’t last very long because of their changeable natures.

As two mutable signs, there will be no end to their creativity and changes in positions, scenery and levels of commitment and intimacy. Their sex life will have ups and downs, excitements and disappointments, too many expectations and a lot of surprises. The best thing about their relationship is the positivity both partners share, and a lot of laughter and fun they will share in their sex life.\nUnfortunately, the level of intimacy will rarely be satisfying for any of these partners. Since they are both ruled by Jupiter, they will be faced with their rational natures and their convictions. The main reason why their sexual relationship rarely comes true is overthinking of both partners. Sagittarius will wait for a grand emotion, grand gesture or any sort of passionate initiative from Pisces, while Pisces will wait for all of the pieces of the puzzle to fit in their perfect position. In most cases, neither of these things will happen and they won’t move further from a platonic relationship.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable. The most important thing he needs to find in his relationship is purpose and a sense of a meaningful future.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

If they connect through deep love, they will overcome this with ease and emotions they share will make Sagittarius understand their partner. In general, they will agree on many things. They will value each other’s utopias, people with good hearts, knowledge, wide perspective and travels. They will understand each other’s sense of not belonging and share the sense of a higher power.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Their sex life could become the source of most of their problems, as soon as Gemini gets bored or Taurus annoyed by the lack of emotional essence.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did.

Their connection is like a “little death” making room for all that is new, untamed and inexperienced. It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes.

Aries representatives will value them because of that sense of strength, power and because of the role of that one and only hero, smarter and braver than everyone else. Pisces value them for their ideals, happy endings and those utopian relationships between those few worthy men and women.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks.

It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided.

Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction.

This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life.

Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

This is one of the typical combinations of zodiac signs for love at first sight. Their main challenge is hidden in the changeable nature of the sign ofPisces, not because it is there, but because they might fear to show it. Their biggest problem lies in the fact that they give priority to different types of love in their life. If passion and sensual, sexual love isn’t there, Pisces will rarely be satisfied with the love they get from their family, and Cancer would find a life without a family nest very depressing. A fine balance needs to be made between excitement and stability, and they could be one of the most wonderful couples of the zodiac – Cancer inspired and Pisces with a feel of home.",

Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality.\nCancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

As much as they will both value being loved and cared for,Cancerwill value a stable emotional situation and a cozy home to come to, while Pisces will probably value any chance for an emotional rollercoaster more. It is often said that Pisces idealize partners and different things in life, but in fact they get depressed when there is no magic and perfect beauty surrounding them. If their day to day life with a Cancer partner becomes anything similar to a boring routine, they will find a way to run off, find a lover or create any sort of truly exciting circumstances.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

Libra, on the other hand, values justice and one’s ability to be the hero – something they often think they lack. They are finely compatible when it comes to matters of the Sun and they complement each other well in a way that helps them both learn about expressing themselves and their abilities and strengths. The problem with this couple is in their relationship toward Saturn, and while Leo represents its detriment, Libra exalts it. Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand.

When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Capricorn values stability, punctuality and plain honesty. Although they will both be dazzled by the independence of their partner, the rest of their worlds rarely coincide that much.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

This could easily lead to a struggle for supremacy and a battle to reach the ruling position among them. This comes as a continuation of Libra’s bruised Sun and a Sagittarius will fit in perfectly with the need to give away every sense of pride out of some childish convictions.

They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable.

Libra doesn’t seem like a creative person to others, but a Sagittarius sees their intellect through communication and motivates them to show their warmth. This leads to shared value of their entire relationship and an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. Even if they don’t start their relationship in the same place, they will have the opportunity to build similar values in time, showing each other what’s truly important.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

This is what makes them great as colleagues, but this is not exactly the most important set of values a happy couple would share. Their relationship could be based on their joint business though. This would give more meaning to their conversations and everyday life.\nOther things they value don’t coincide that much. Aries is all for bravery and an attitude while Virgo thinks of these as stupid, unless they are a part of tradition or have historic significance. Virgo values intelligence while Aries thinks success has nothing to do with it and sees it as a possible reason for loneliness and sorrow. Still, these would rather be the reasons to tease each other and have a nice laugh, than they would have the capacity to tear their relationship apart.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

There are Capricorn representatives who have changed many partners, but they will probably never stay with the one that isn’t family oriented and emotional when it comes to physical relations.\nIntimacy Cancer can create is exactly compatible to what Capricorn lacks. There is a lack of love, home and warmth in the sign ofCapricorn, and Cancer partner can heal this with their highly compassionate approach. This could lead to thawing of Capricorn’s emotional state and uplift the state of their sex life significantly.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves.

The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave.

They both need stability in their lives and will value people who give them the sense of security. This is probably something they will value most in each other, the ability of both not to quit or give up, however hard things might get.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this.

You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously.

If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

They discover a pleasure of sex they have never had the opportunity to experience, for they perfectly understand each other’s need for touch and the stimulation of all senses. The sign of Taurus is the most sensual sign of the entire zodiac, that is, when they are not too lazy to discover their sexuality. If they don’t lack in primal sexual drive, they will probably build a strong and gentle sexual relationship, in which both of them will have their needs met.\nThe problem they might encounter is the possibility that none of them will have enough initiative. Still, they are usually stubborn enough to overcome this small obstacle. Since they share sexual fantasies and ideas about intimacy, with enough openness and communication they should be able to overcome any obstacle they stumble upon. That is, if they don’t stubbornly wait for the other person to make the first move. This could make them both wait forever.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.",

This is a sign that represents all value and withholds in itself the price of everything in this world. What a Taurus partner values is primarily someone’s respect toward the value itself. Be it the financial value of any object in their surroundings or the value of being loved, the awareness of it is something they consider imperative for their partner to have.\nTwo Taurus in a relationship value values together and a conflict can arise only if they assign different values to different things. Still, in most cases, they will give enough space to one another to set an individual list of priorities and find a compromise if some things are more valuable to one of them, than to the other.\nHe is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.",

It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\nLeois a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last.

Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love.

The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that.

Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away.

He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything.

He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with.

It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets.

He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.",

Leo can be smitten by someone’s mind, and this is exactly what Virgo has to give, in case they are not to closed up to show it. If they work together, they might create the exact atmosphere in which anything can be created, but only if they share similar professional interests. Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

This could lead to their emotional relationship blossoming, but no sexual chemistry between them.\nIt is a good thing they both don’t need much experience or technical knowledge in their sexual encounters, because this gives them a chance to base their sex life exclusively on emotions they have for each other.

No Cancer will be satisfied with a boring emotional life, even though they might seem that way. They will fight for their family, for intimacy and their safe haven, but they will not settle for something that doesn’t excite them at all. In order for the relationship of two of them to succeed, it would be a good idea to experiment a little and show initiative at any time they feel the least bit sexual.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves.

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her.

When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion.

This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.",

In many cases this is not a couple that will last very long, as their mutable quality makes them changeable enough to disregard the entire relationship quickly if they aren’t satisfied.

        "text": "Virgo and Pisces are opposing signs and their attraction is very strong. Since they also represent the axis of Venus’ fall and exaltation, we can conclude that their relationship always has a lesson on Venus to teach. These partners have a task to find the place of physical intimacy in which they will both be relaxed to be exactly who they are.\nVirgo partner will usually be shy, trying to show their sexuality through rational behavior, and Pisces will see right through this. On the other hand, Pisces will fear close physical connection with another person, and this will be practically dismissed by Virgo. As they both learn that they cannot hide who they are, they will have no choice but to set themselves free from any fear and shame, giving in to the wonderful sexual experience Venus has to offer.\nThis is a couple that will never have instinctive sex, however passionate they might get. Virgo’s analytical mind wouldn’t allow for them to act “like animals”, and this is something that Pisces will find so humanlike and attractive. Virgo will mostly be attracted by the purity of sex with Pisces, who truly approach it as an act of love, free from prejudice and following their inner feeling, wherever it leads.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

This is their meeting point and it can make them divine, or constantly dissatisfied with the need to change everything about their partner. Both of these partners will value flexibility, someone’s ability to adapt and change, and they will most certainly value the love they get from their partner. Still, their differences in approach to one’s beliefs and convictions might be huge, and acceptance between them needs to be unconditional.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

There is a strong link between these two signs, and in their sexual relationship, things will most certainly never get boring. At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\nAs a mutable sign,Pisceshave an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens.

Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find. However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn't sound promising, does it?\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time.

However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom.

The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\nThe problem with sexual relations with anAriesis that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes.

Their values aren’t even connected, except for the fact they both have the idea that some sort of future balance, that can be quite hard to achieve, would make them better.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

        "text": "They simply don’t value the same things. Although this is the point where they separate their ways, it usually takes them long to realize this fact. Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\nVirgois a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.",

Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers.

Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment.

In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked.

Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.",

Leo can be smitten by someone’s mind, and this is exactly what Virgo has to give, in case they are not to closed up to show it. If they work together, they might create the exact atmosphere in which anything can be created, but only if they share similar professional interests. Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.",

Of course they both want true, magical, mystical love with Venus exalted in Pisces, but Taurus values tenderness and touch on their way to get there, while Libra values responsibility and seriousness. However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

The strength of character they share is something that will give them just the right amount of confidence when it comes to sex, and the creativity and openness of Sagittarius will be refreshing for the fixed nature of Scorpio. However, this often doesn’t last very long and in time, in most cases, Scorpio starts thinking of their Sagittarius partner as unreliable and not to be trusted, while Sagittarius sees Scorpio as dark, pushy and too controlling.\nIn order to remain in a healthy sexual relationship, both of these partners have to compromise, Scorpio finding a way to give freedom, while Sagittarius finding a way not to run away from the seriousness of their partner.

This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries.

They can both feel like outcasts and value each other’s decisions to differ from others out of self-respect. Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

This can make them speak without words, understand each other’s thoughts with only one shared glance and be synchronized in their approach to their future together.\nIf their emotions aren’t shared on a deepest possible level, or Scorpio partner refuses to deal with them, it could be too hard for Cancer to handle the self-destructive nature of their partner. Their connection needs to be sincere and pure, in order for both of them to be ready to give in to this intense emotional contact.",

Cancer can usually understand the need of their Scorpio partner to express their deepest, darkest emotions in their sex life. If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any. When they fall in love, they will both need to express their feelings and the intimacy they might share is incredible.\nHowever,Scorpiois a sign in which the Moon falls and this is the ruler of the sign ofCancer. If Scorpio’s need to bury their emotions is too intense, there is a great chance they will be too rough or insensitive on their partner. This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

It can be difficult for these partners to coordinate their personalities if they are both not flexible enough to understand their differences and the depth each of them has behind these superficial needs. Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

If Cancer falls in love deeply enough, they will understand what their Gemini partner needs, and won’t hold them back even if they wished for them to be different.\nGemini partner has to open their heart and listen to those few words that Cancer wants to share. Even though they can speak about many things, when it comes to discussions of their relationship, their views on it are different.

This is not always the case, of course, but it is very rare for a Gemini partner to manage to relax their Cancer and make them join their sexual adventure. Still, there is a link between them, pretty strong for that matter. Cancer continues the sign ofGemini, and in a way their nature is a consequence of endless conversations and rational explanations.\nIf Gemini partner has enough patience to talk to their partner about same things over and over, in time they could build enough intimacy to have a good sex life. In order for this scenario to develop, Cancer needs to talk, too. It will not be enough to say a sentence or two and expect that their Gemini will understand how they feel. If they manage to communicate, Cancer could actually wake the depth of their Gemini, giving them enough support to express their more emotional sexual personality.\nIf they want their relationship to work, their sex life needs to be somewhere in the middle – intimate enough and exciting enough – for both partners to be satisfied.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy.

While Gemini is a rational sign, giving value to all that comes out of their mind, Cancer is an emotional guru, giving value to things their heart beats for. When it comes to relationships, they are probably the most vulnerable to differences in this category, for differences here make their primary goals different. Although they will both be motivated to find love, the way their partner acts in a relationship could be considered “wrong” due to its opposite nature from what each of them values.\nThe sign ofGeminicontrols speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.",

Their connection is like a “little death” making room for all that is new, untamed and inexperienced. It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis.

When they get involved, trust becomes something like a sole purpose of their entire relationship.\nThey will also both like fairytale heroes and value the usual pride, chastity and bravery scenario. Still, the core of these values is different for the two of them. Aries representatives will value them because of that sense of strength, power and because of the role of that one and only hero, smarter and braver than everyone else. Pisces value them for their ideals, happy endings and those utopian relationships between those few worthy men and women.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

On the other hand, Pisces will fear close physical connection with another person, and this will be practically dismissed by Virgo. As they both learn that they cannot hide who they are, they will have no choice but to set themselves free from any fear and shame, giving in to the wonderful sexual experience Venus has to offer.\nThis is a couple that will never have instinctive sex, however passionate they might get. Virgo’s analytical mind wouldn’t allow for them to act “like animals”, and this is something that Pisces will find so humanlike and attractive. Virgo will mostly be attracted by the purity of sex with Pisces, who truly approach it as an act of love, free from prejudice and following their inner feeling, wherever it leads.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

Both of these partners will value flexibility, someone’s ability to adapt and change, and they will most certainly value the love they get from their partner. Still, their differences in approach to one’s beliefs and convictions might be huge, and acceptance between them needs to be unconditional.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

When they fall in love, they will rarely find the reason to separate, because of their shared emotional goals for love, understanding, family and the feeling of home. This is the relationship that seems like a perpetuum mobile of love, in case both partners don’t already have too much emotional baggage that makes them unable to give and receive this depth of emotion.

        "text": "Someone might think that Taurus and Cancer are two of the most asexual signs in the entire zodiac. This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit over exaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

        "text": "Most of all, they both value life and peace. Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another.

These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied.With a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child.

However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life.

Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love.

She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap.

She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

Even when they stumble upon a disagreement, there is a great chance they will laugh it off and forget about it in a couple of hours. The positivity of this clash of fiery Suns is something that can overcome any value previously set, and they will easily adapt to one another and find a perfect compromise, even when they disagree. The most important value they share is the one they both give to freedom of spirit and the goodness of humankind. When they find this point of shared utopia, there is nothing else that will truly matter.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths.",

Our family is presented by the sign of Cancer and the Moon, and it is a psychological challenge for all of us to understand that our parents are sexual beings. This would be fine if the members of this universal Cancer family weren’t convinced in their asexual nature as well. Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\nThe problem with sexual relations with anAriesis that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.",

Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

Virgo is an Earth sign ruled by Mercury, relying highly on their intellect, while bringing Venus to its fall. Libra is an Air sign ruled by Venus, and couldn’t be more distant from Virgo’s shy nature or practicality when it comes to sex. They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal.

This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.",

        "text": "It is a funny thing to talk about the system of values when we speak of Taurus. This is a sign that represents all value and withholds in itself the price of everything in this world. What a Taurus partner values is primarily someone’s respect toward the value itself. Be it the financial value of any object in their surroundings or the value of being loved, the awareness of it is something they consider imperative for their partner to have.\nTwo Taurus in a relationship value values together and a conflict can arise only if they assign different values to different things. Still, in most cases, they will give enough space to one another to set an individual list of priorities and find a compromise if some things are more valuable to one of them, than to the other.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.",

When they start dating, their sexual relationship might come as a surprise for both of them, for they will feel liberated to be exactly who they are with each other. The best thing they could do is use the trine between their Suns and build-up each other’s self-esteem, especially if they have been in demanding or disrespectful relationships prior to theirs.\nThe best thing about their sex life is the passion they share. Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons. They will both enjoy each other in a fiery way and respect each other’s bodies, minds and entire personalities. If they stumble upon one another and love is born, their sex life could represent a perfect connection for both of them.\nWhen Leo man finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

Still, it is not easy to explain to a Leo why it is so good to run away from the world, travel in Greenland alone, and eat bugs somewhere in Asia, except if one wants to show their courage. On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people. So although they value the same thing – courage, they see it through different eyes.\nTo understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something that will accent Leo man manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths",

They have a possibility to become an inspirational contact of heart and mind, if only they give in to the opportunity to enter each other’s worlds.\nTheir sexual relationship seems to be a lecture on emotion. The sign ofVirgobrings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt. She needs to accept that perfectionism isn’t her best trait and that it keeps her from being happy about imperfect things in her life which are… well all of them.",

To Virgo, their Cancer partner will seem much more down to earth and rational than they are, and to Cancer, their Virgo partner will have a recognized soft spot in their heart. Other things won’t matter much when they find each other, because there is no compromise they both wouldn’t make to keep this love going. However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship. As a deeply emotional and the most intelligent sign in the zodiac, one of them values family, love and understanding, and the other intellect, attention to detail and their health. It is not like they don’t have a meeting point, but it will not be easily found if they both stubbornly keep to their habits and opinions.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

Both planets are in connection with physical relations, but their biggest difference is in their final goal when it comes to sex.\nAries in its rough form is guided by a simple instinct, the need for continuation of the species and the transfer of genetic material to the next generation. On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once.

Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction.

This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back.

Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

It is not an easy job, reconciling Saturn with the Sun, but it brings great benefits when it is done. The structure Leo could get and the creativity they might build on together could lift them to exactly what they desired, however their relationship might end.

It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\nLeois a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

Leo is not much of a plan maker, they would rather go with the flow and look only a couple of days in advance, and they respect Capricorn’s ability to focus on the final destination and weigh every step of the way. Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

Still, they part ways in their further processing of these.\nWhile Aries considers something is done with as soon as it’s cleared, Scorpio will dig for reasons why it would be unclear, or was unclear in the first place. So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

In combination with other signs of the zodiac it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.\nThe problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away.\nTheir different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

Whatever their goals, they could easily reach them together due to the fact they share the same material values to begin with. Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point.

Pisces, on the other hand, exalt Venus, and they only want to have sex with the love of their life, unless they’ve been disappointed too many times. If they meet after these numerous disappointments, Gemini will not find Pisces very attractive, for they will no longer have any childish energy or charm.\nIf their sex life is supposed to be functional, both of them will have to find a way to be a bit more grounded than they normally are. Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did.

She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

The main issue of speed is usually overcome by the quickly changeable nature of Pisces, except in cases when they are too shy to jump into a sexual relation with someone as openly sexual as Libra.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way. If her partner wants to hold on to her, it is best to simply let her be who she is and hope for the best.",

With Venus at focus, they will both need to be loved and cherish those who know how to show it, hot to enjoy life, food and sex, and how to make their loved ones satisfied. This could give them a strong foundation for a sexual relationship if they are attracted to each other in the first place. The rest of their characters will differ greatly and while Libra will value consistency and stability, Pisces will value spontaneity and one’s ability to follow their heart. If they both believe that they have a mission here on Earth, and it happens that their missions cross paths, they could inspire each other to fight for what they value most – their names in the stars.\nLibra is a woman that must have unresolved issues with her father and she is not easy to understand. She can be wonderful, caring, give you her undivided attention and be just and responsible more than any other sign. But her low self-esteem makes her dependent on opinions of others, or too quick to show she doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion. She doesn’t understand why other people don’t act in the way she would, and this makes her question her every move. We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word.

When they engage in intimate relations, it is expected for all their libido and possible problems with sexual expression to surface. Attraction they feel toward each other is great, but their signs combined present passive-aggressive behavior in general and as a couple they could have a tendency to hurt each other in intimate relations.\nRuled by Mars, Aries is a sign of Saturn’s debilitation and Libra exalts it, so their main issue is the lack of emotion and poor boundaries when it comes to sex. Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

Capricorn is ruled by Saturn that exalts in Libra. In the practical sense, this means that Libra helps Aries achieve their goals, while following necessary values. This is an interesting observation because the sign of Aries is the sign of Saturn’s debilitation and doesn’t seem to understand the set of values or exact steps that would lead them to their goal. It is almost as if Libra knew the way for Aries to reach their goals by discovering new values in relationship with them.\nIn general, their individual values are different in so many ways, but it is exactly the purpose of their relationship to question them and set them straight. Aries values direct, energized approach and outspoken people. Libra values tact, fineness and prestige. While Aries gives their best to live in the now, Libra examines the past to set distant targets in the future. They have a lot to learn from each other, but if they do, they might just set their mutual values somewhere in the middle.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper.

This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world.

We can say that everyLibrais indecisive, but the truth is, this woman cares too much about the future to let things slide, and takes on too much guilt and responsibility. This inevitably leads to a state of self-pity and taking the role of a victim.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEven though the sign of Libra exalts Saturn, the Air element of this sign will make her more fascinated by a nice surprise than following the expected routine. It wouldn’t be good to miss her birthday or your anniversary, but it would be much worse to give her presents only on those occasions. Surprise your Libra. Buy her flowers or a well-balanced perfume. She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it.

Imagine what these partners could do together if they let each other lead the way when the territory of their rule is in front of them. They both need to learn to let go of the image they have about themselves and about each other, or they won’t get very far stuck in their unnecessary ego battle. Warm and cold, hearted and smart, nuclear gravitation and vacuum in space, it cannot be easy to mend their differences or form a stable, loving relationship. The best thing they could do is find a cause they will support together.

Leo is the king of the entire zodiac, and Aquarius seems to be there to bring down the king and fight for independence. Imagine the attraction and the passion between two such strong individuals, lying on the axis of Sun’s rule and detriment.\nTheir sex life is a struggle, a fight and an incredible experience for both. Liberating and yet warm and passionate, sensual but still interesting. When they find true emotion, Aquarius might actually end up respecting the king. The beauty of their sex life is in things they can learn about their bodies, their confidence and the way they look at the act of sex. Through the struggle of insecurities and forced liberation, these are two partners to form a strong connection by a simple act of gravitation that the Sun has over Uranus.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

Although they will not agree on many other things, this is the one that could connect them strongly, because they are both such strong individuals in the eyes of each other.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

Still, there is a link between them, pretty strong for that matter. Cancer continues the sign ofGemini, and in a way their nature is a consequence of endless conversations and rational explanations.If Gemini partner has enough patience to talk to their partner about same things over and over, in time they could build enough intimacy to have a good sex life. In order for this scenario to develop, Cancer needs to talk, too. It will not be enough to say a sentence or two and expect that their Gemini will understand how they feel.

He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy.

Although they will both be motivated to find love, the way their partner acts in a relationship could be considered “wrong” due to its opposite nature from what each of them values.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that.

While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship.

However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

None of these partners realizes that this takes away their emotional or sexual satisfaction, and makes them feel tense. In most cases they just realize that they don’t feel relaxed with one another, often not even knowing why.\nThe good thing in a sexual relationship of two Virgos is their respect for each other’s sense of shame and the pace they want their relationship to move in. Their mutable quality will help them make the necessary changes to make things work, and even if their sex life isn’t satisfying in the beginning, they might be able to adapt until they reach the point of satisfaction. Creativity is the key here. And their training to live in the moment, without noticing every single detail that doesn’t work between them.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one.

The strength of character they share is something that will give them just the right amount of confidence when it comes to sex, and the creativity and openness of Sagittarius will be refreshing for the fixed nature of Scorpio. However, this often doesn’t last very long and in time, in most cases, Scorpio starts thinking of their Sagittarius partner as unreliable and not to be trusted, while Sagittarius sees Scorpio as dark, pushy and too controlling.\nIn order to remain in a healthy sexual relationship, both of these partners have to compromise, Scorpio finding a way to give freedom, while Sagittarius finding a way not to run away from the seriousness of their partner. In the best possible contact, Scorpio will give their sex life emotion and true physical intimacy, while Sagittarius will be there to give meaning and shake things up, representing the light at the end of a tunnel. Together, they can build an incredible sexual relationship, for both tend to be uninhibited about locations, positions and situations in which they wish to make love.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

They can both feel like outcasts and value each other’s decisions to differ from others out of self-respect. Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact. It will eventually bring her to that utopian place, whether you believe it or not.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nSagittarius is a woman whose Sun sign is ruled by Jupiter, and she will love presents all together. It doesn’t matter what you buy, for as long as it puts a smile on her face. She doesn’t care much if things are practical or not, wearable or not, for as long as attention is given and her character well assessed. Surprise her and show her that you value her independence and her sense of adventure. Take her someplace she loves to go, pick some flowers from your grandma’s garden on your way to see her, and show her you understand her passions and strengths",

She will value a piece of jewelry, a feminine watch or anything artistic and beautiful. She needs balance in her life, and she will like her presents to be moderate, not too colorful or pap. She will always be happy to get an unexpected box of chocolate, followed by a red rose, even if she feels guilty about her weight and the chocolate she will eat.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful.

If they stubbornly decide they love each other too much to let each other go, both of them would probably bang their heads against a wall for years to come.\nTheir only chance of success is unconditional respect and the wideness of their views and expectations. They could truly complement each other, but only in a scenario where they would look for good in one another and highlight each other’s qualities. Unfortunately, the malefic nature of their rulers rarely allows for them to be this positive and acceptance oriented. If they got together, and whatever their story is, they should think about the things they could learn from each other instead of looking for each other’s shortcomings, and always stay out of each other’s business.",

These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision. She is serious and strict, but her love goes very deep, and unless she is dissatisfied with her own life, she will support her partner and make them very happy.",

        "text": "They both value independence, clarity and honesty, and in general their system of values is not what brings problems to their relationship. Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values.\nIf Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

The sign ofVirgobrings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy.

However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship.

Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side.

Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories.

The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship. He does live dependent on traditional values, and he would really like if someone would take care of him while he takes care of the world.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you.

In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nThe biggest problem Pisces woman has to deal with is the feeling that she doesn’t belong anywhere. Because of the position of the Sun in this sign, the image of the father is almost always off. Either he was not present in her life, or he is wildly idealized, and she has difficulty finding a partner to achieve this image of an almighty man. Whatever the situation, she can be lost, and the only way she can compensate for her differences is to follow her mission, whatever she feels it is. Her partner must never obstruct her on this path, or their relationship will be no more.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.\nBe as creative as possible. Write your Pisces woman a poem, sing her a song, learn how to play the flute and surprise her by singing her favorite tune. Paint her a picture of the two of you in a place she wishes to see. Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

They are not two brutes who let their relationship fade as soon as their passion does, but the distant examining look of Aquarius can take out the emotion out of it. Aries partner needs to be relaxed by their significant other, so they can melt down and show their true, warm emotional nature. In this relationship, they would have a distant partner that basically supports their primal, instinctive nature. Although it is nice to think that the point of each relationship is for partners to accept each other as they are, in this case that would take away every chance for an Aries to grow through togetherness and learn about their emotional nature. This is something they will never be satisfied with.\nStill, every relationship with Aquarius can surprise us as much as any individual Aquarius could. With them as a partner, there is always room for an enlightening scenario that leaves all things to free will. In case they decide to share their lives together, they should have a screaming room they could individually visit once in a while. This would probably do the trick.

Their signs go well together in general and they support each other easily, since they both have a lot of energy to follow one another. Still, when it comes to their sexual and intimate relations, they could lack emotion. Aries is a passionate sign with lot of warm, creative emotions. This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries. This is very fun at the beginning of their relationship, but after a while, it might get tiresome for there are not enough ideas to cover the emotional emptiness they could encounter.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nAn Aquarius man can be difficult to be with. His Sun is in detriment and this makes him vulnerable to all sorts of issues with respect and sometimes makes him take everything that is said way too personally. He will not be hurt that easily, because of his very strong mind, but the feel of constant disrespect might make him distant and detached, as if the person he is with doesn’t deserve to understand his personality. This can be challenging even for a partner with a very strong personality and the most important thing here is to set clear agreements on the way both partners will approach each other, as soon as the relationship starts.",

But in time, Aries realizes that they don’t really value freedom that much when they see it at work. In fact, they would often change everything in their lives only to take away the freedom from their Aquarius partner. This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nAquarius man is talented, idealistic and humane, sticking strongly to his beliefs and guarding his ideals with his life. His mission is not to irritate everyone around him, but to set them free of their prejudice and superficial rules of behavior. It is not easy to understand him, because he doesn’t use the usual forms of communication to show his inner Self. Most of the time he will simply hold on to the strengths of his mind and have a distant, dignified attitude that leaves no room for closeness. If you manage to reach his core, you might find that his image hid some true fireworks in his heart.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nAny modern, shiny, technical gadget will do. Aquarius man will act like a little child if he gets a new laptop or a telephone, with an instruction manual longer than your average encyclopedia. He wants to read… anything, from labels on a detergent bottle, to science fiction novels. This is a man who doesn’t care much about his birthday or holidays, but will love to be surprised by something he really needs, or a work of modern art that caught his eye, at any possible moment.",

While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

Of course they both want true, magical, mystical love with Venus exalted in Pisces, but Taurus values tenderness and touch on their way to get there, while Libra values responsibility and seriousness. However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

Still, the shy nature of Virgo and their caution when it comes to choosing a sexual partner might make it difficult for them to find a language they both understand. Leo wants to be with a partner that makes them feel special and even more confident than they already are, and this is hard for Virgo to give. Their relationship can be quite challenging because the passionate nature of Leo doesn’t give much space to Virgo to feel protected and secure about their choices. Their rationality might turn into an intellectual battle for sexual dominance, that is, if they ever reach the point in which they both want to have sex with each other.\nIt is a good thing thatLeois a fixed sign, so they have a conservative note to them that suits Virgo. Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nDepending on what you are looking for, Virgo can be a very satisfying man to be with or a very annoying one. He is dedicated to his partner, but he is ruled by Mercury and this leads to a sort of double personality that cannot always be trusted. He can be quite superficial when it comes to emotional closeness and intimacy, but he is intelligent enough not to let go of the partner he is in love with. He likes his routine and needs some healthy choices in his life, whether he is aware of this or not, and it can make him demanding in a relationship.

Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nVirgo is a man that has one mission in life – to fix something. Until he does, it will not be easy for him to relax, smile, dance and be as happy as you might want him to be. He is serious because he has some serious details to commit to, and unless he finds a way to make constructive use of his mind at his work, he might drive you mad analyzing your every word. Let him have those already used things and fix everything around the house. His hands need to be put to good use or he will tell you all about the bad use of yours. Virgo is a sign meant to fix all that was broken and while you get annoyed by him, think if you were maybe chosen to be fixed yourself.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nVirgo is not a man that needs that many surprises. Everyone likes a nice surprise here and there, but the most important thing for him is to honor traditions, birthdays, anniversaries and successes. He will treasure a pen, a notebook, a laptop or anything he can write on, even if he claims he is not into writing. Buy him a transparent, manly watch, with all the gear wheels shown, or any book on how stuff works. He will want to see how things are made or fixed, and he will be thankful for all sorts of fine tools that allow him to do something practical that needs to be done at the moment. If nothing else makes him happy, you can always buy him an enormous puzzle of 5000 little pieces. This should keep him occupied for a while.",

On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.\nPisces is a woman that will hold on to a relationship for as long as it inspires her and makes her wonder about its outcome. She can often hold on to ideas of platonic love, in hope that the day will come when her love will finally be realized in some magical way. She chooses these distant, unreal relationships when she fears reality too much, and especially before she becomes sexually active. As a muse, she will bring inspiration to her partner, with feelings of adequacy and talent to follow. However, she will change her mind quickly as soon as she feels pressured or disrespected, or her love simply dies down. It is not possible to rely on her love, and she is always open for the possibility that there might be someone out there who can love her in a better way.

However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.\nBe as creative as possible.

Make a collage of your pictures together and frame it so she can hang it on a wall. She will enjoy a beautiful perfume, but when you choose one, take her sensitivity to smell into consideration. Every gift you choose for your Pisces woman should be creative and romantic, and you should always spend some time thinking about the ideas she might cherish most. It is really not that hard to buy her something she will like. Just let it be colorful or magical, and put some of your energy into it.",

It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.",

Capricorn is ruled by Saturn that exalts in Libra. In the practical sense, this means that Libra helps Aries achieve their goals, while following necessary values. This is an interesting observation because the sign of Aries is the sign of Saturn’s debilitation and doesn’t seem to understand the set of values or exact steps that would lead them to their goal. It is almost as if Libra knew the way for Aries to reach their goals by discovering new values in relationship with them.\nIn general, their individual values are different in so many ways, but it is exactly the purpose of their relationship to question them and set them straight. Aries values direct, energized approach and outspoken people. Libra values tact, fineness and prestige. While Aries gives their best to live in the now, Libra examines the past to set distant targets in the future. They have a lot to learn from each other, but if they do, they might just set their mutual values somewhere in the middle.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

Our family is presented by the sign of Cancer and the Moon, and it is a psychological challenge for all of us to understand that our parents are sexual beings.

Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\nThe problem with sexual relations with anAriesis that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two.

If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.",

He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories.

He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.",

Now think of Gemini. It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.",

The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\nVirgois a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her.

Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook.

Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though.

When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.\nThe problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away.\nTheir different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her.

It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nWhen Capricorn woman chooses a partner, this is a woman that has the need to stay loyal, and often doesn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. The equation in her head is quite simple, and for as long as her relationships make any sense, she will stay in them with no intention to disappoint or leave. When she feels the time has come for things to end, all of her boundaries have probably been crossed and there’s a slim chance there will be turning back on her decision.

Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life.

If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

        "text": "Cancer values knowledge almost as much as Aquarius values information. This is a fine connection between their worlds and if it is nurtured it could be just enough for them not to be set apart by other values they hold on to. Cancer does value stability, intimacy and family, while Aquarius values their freedom, intellect and new technology. There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

Their sex life can be stimulated by their intellect and communication, for they both rely on their conscious Self and their mind. If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality. Leo could be the right partner to teach them how to make a real intimate connection if they are not preoccupied with themselves. They will both want to experiment, have sexual encounters outdoors and will enjoy being naked. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to overcome shame and any sort of fear regarding intimacy and sexuality.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship.

In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

This is why as soon as the first excitement and attraction start to fade, and the need for true emotional contact emerges, they might have trouble staying together.\nHowever, if they are both looking for an occasional fling, this might be the best contact of signs in the entire zodiac to have one. There will be no better understanding for the sense of freedom and the need for the lack of intimacy as these two might have in certain conditions. Unfortunately, this is usually not enough to support their future together and they will both probably need someone they could love more and who would care about them in a different way.\nAquarius woman is exciting, unpredictable, and not someone to choose to be with, if you are searching for a stable, secure relationship without waves and emotional challenges. She doesn’t like to be tied down, although she will do anything for the right partner, and unless she feels her biological clock ticking, she will not give in to the formal expectations of a relationship. The most important thing one should keep in mind when starting a relationship with this woman, is that she can be swept off her feet only by respect and a surprise or two in return.",

        "text": "It would be funny to assume that two members of the same sign have different values. But when we look at the sign of Aquarius we see that what they value is closely connected to their home and the way they were raised. As two rebellious, opinionated people, they need similar upbringing if they are to understand each other. The good thing is that they both value their freedom to extremes and this will connect them even when there are many other things they disagree on.\nThe sign of Aquarius represents an opposition and it is not easy for this woman to settle the conflict she carries within, that always tells her respect needs to be earned. She might never realize that respect is her given right and that she doesn’t need to fight for it all the time. Her biggest challenge is in finding inner, emotional peace, and when she gets hurt too many times, she easily closes her heart and moves on with her life from a strictly rational point.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThis should be easy – buy your Aquarius woman something you wouldn’t buy for any other woman. It is important to understand that under her detached exterior hides a real woman that likes to be surprised by something romantic and beautiful. This doesn’t mean that she will be crazy about a dozen red roses or a candlelight dinner, and although she might be satisfied enough by something similar, it is best to go with presents that are a little more unusual. If you want to pick out a gift she will use, look for technical things she might need, in a purple or a silver tone. Pick out a good astrology reading or prepare some fireworks as an anniversary surprise. You might discover that it is truly easy to give her something she will treasure, if only you rely on your creativity and your inner feeling of excitement.",

If they found their relationship on a strong mutual attraction, they could enjoy a satisfying sex life for a very long time.\nLeo doesn’t mind being seen and Libra is a sign that represents the public eye.

As soon as any restrictions show up, they will have to play out their passionate scenarios at any time, and in any place in which they get a chance to be alone if only for a minute.

Libra, on the other hand, values justice and one’s ability to be the hero – something they often think they lack. They are finely compatible when it comes to matters of the Sun and they complement each other well in a way that helps them both learn about expressing themselves and their abilities and strengths. The problem with this couple is in their relationship toward Saturn, and while Leo represents its detriment, Libra exalts it. Although this can be a lesson to be learned, the challenge of responsibility they take on unequally can tear them apart. Leo needs to get serious and realize what their responsibility is to fit into the thing Libra values most – reliability and tact.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.",

It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead.

When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often.

For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\nIn a relationship with a Libra woman, you can expect anything, for as long as it is well “packed”. She will be caring and deep, but also be prepared to show her selfish, manipulative side, wrapped in candy paper. It can be hard to understand her position, because she will rarely show her uncontrolled emotions and passions, so the right partner needs to know her deeply and intimately, including the things she doesn’t want to show. In general, when she decides to be with someone, she will be committed and loyal. Even though she can often be too worried about other people’s opinions, she will stick to her choices even if they are not good for her.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments.

Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.",

        "text": "This is an area in which they match quite well. Although they seem completely different, their main objectives are pretty much the same. They both value material security, since Aries is ruled by Mars, a planet connected to the fear of existential crisis, and Taurus is an Earth sign, material in their core and very inclined to the financial world. They both cherish character and strength, physical and verbal, and need someone who will not disappoint them as the first impression fades.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.",

Both of them are strong individuals, each on their own plane. Their lack of understanding and emotional touch can be explained through the fact that both of them have a mission to spread love to the less fortunate signs of the zodiac. Not everyone is born with an emotional flow like Cancer and a huge, warm heart like Leo.

Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",

Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side. Although civilization is on its way to accept all sorts of human natures, especially the emotional one, it always seems judged by potential partners or wildly misread in general.Canceralways has a family issue to resolve and accept, positive or negative, and it is always best to have a peek into his relationship with his mother in order to understand him better. When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.",

This can make them speak without words, understand each other’s thoughts with only one shared glance and be synchronized in their approach to their future together.\nIf their emotions aren’t shared on a deepest possible level, or Scorpio partner refuses to deal with them, it could be too hard for Cancer to handle the self-destructive nature of their partner.

Cancer can usually understand the need of their Scorpio partner to express their deepest, darkest emotions in their sex life. If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any. When they fall in love, they will both need to express their feelings and the intimacy they might share is incredible.\nHowever,Scorpiois a sign in which the Moon falls and this is the ruler of the sign ofCancer. If Scorpio’s need to bury their emotions is too intense, there is a great chance they will be too rough or insensitive on their partner. This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves. When emotional stability is established and she finds herself in a loving relationship that is to last, she will want to do what is “normal” – get married and have children.\nScorpio women’s relationships are always going to extremes, at least inside her mind and her heart. Even if she is well taught to hide how she feels, she will accumulate every emotion she’s ever had and end relationships for reasons that can’t seem to be explained. The main goal for any partner of hers should be to find the way to communicate without words. She needs to be felt instead of heard, and listening to her shouldn’t be an issue with words as sharp as knives most of the time. She can be possessive, but she will never ask for things she isn’t prepared to give back. If you want someone to remain faithful to you until death, you will have to fulfill her needs and show her you belong to her as much as you want her to belong to you.",

It can be difficult for these partners to coordinate their personalities if they are both not flexible enough to understand their differences and the depth each of them has behind these superficial needs. Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nScorpio woman is not a typical woman, ruled by Pluto and Mars, but more like a goddess of female initiative, practicality and strength. Her body is her temple, and she wants to feel physical love more than anything else in her life. However, it is not easy for her to accept the personality she was born with, and she often allows her Sun to become this sleepy mass of energy that isn’t focused into things she loves. Her career needs to be set and she really needs to understand what she wants out of life. If she doesn’t, her frustration and the feeling she doesn’t fit into anyone’s expectations or needs, might make her a bit too hard to handle.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nOf all the women born with the Sun in all other signs of the zodiac, Scorpio woman is probably the most challenging when it comes to presents. She loves surprises, and she will cherish any good deed and a thought pointed in her direction. However, when a demanding situation arises, such as her birthday or an anniversary, most of Scorpio women’s partners fall into desperation for nothing can be bought that will satisfy her. This is simply not true. She gives the impression of someone self-sufficient, someone who has no needs, but if you listen carefully, you might discover she finds joy in the smallest of things. She will not care for jewelry unless it fits her character, but she can fall to pieces over fluorescent stars for her bedroom. Her present needs to have real emotion hidden behind it, and you can’t miss if you just look inside your heart.",

Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this.

They value depth and this is something they will find incredibly soothing in one another, for they will both feel like they don’t need to pretend to be shallow anymore. They will both value practicality, grounding, money and rational investments. The main difference they have to resolve here is in the value of Capricorn’s goals, for they might be ready to do too much from Virgo’s point of view, in order to reach them. In return, Capricorn doesn’t understand Virgo’s lack of motivation and their lack of need to claim the leading position.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.\nA Capricorn woman is often too practical for a typical feminine gift, but also likes to smell good and feel good and cozy in her own skin. It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

Although their chances to reconcile their differences are slim, if Taurus partner puts their whole heart into it, they might manage to become the most relevant part of their Gemini’s life as their base and their reliability in everything they do. In case they accept each other completely, Taurus will give Gemini their connection to planet Earth, to their body and their daily routine, giving them the base for health and normal functioning. In return, Gemini will give their Taurus wings and, better yet, teach them how to fly.",

        "text": "Taurus is a sensual Earth sign with a deep need for physical touch and the joy of all senses of the body. Gemini needs intellectual stimulation and doesn’t care that much about spending time in someone’s arms. It is not as if they don’t have the need to be touched, we all do, but they have to know they are loved and accepted in so many different ways and touch is just one of them. After all, they are one of the Air signs and in their world thoughts have to be preoccupied, while strong communication is something that gives the possibility of a good sexual life.\nWhile Taurus could stay at home, in bed, all they long, cuddling with their sweetheart and ordering food, Gemini would like to get out and be intimate at all not so intimate places. Their sex life could become the source of most of their problems, as soon as Gemini gets bored or Taurus annoyed by the lack of emotional essence.\nTaurus woman is your mother, your cook and your lover all at once. This is probably the most feminine, comfortable, tender sign of the zodiac, ruled by Venus while exalting the Moon. There is nothing mysterious about her once you get to know her. Although she will keep her distance for a long time, once she decides to open up, she will become someone clear, stable and compassionate, your lifelong friend and a partner in crime. It is often said that Taurus likes things nice and boring, but in fact they are ready to deal with anything ugly, for as long as it is shared with someone they love and are in constant need for excitement as Venus has to be.\nYou couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.",

This is where their differences and element natures strongly diverge. They should really try hard to accept the true value of both their worlds in order to work out their differences.\nIf you have a strong masculine nature, understanding Taurus woman might not be easy. It is almost impossible for some men not to take her for granted. Her compassionate nature and the feel she has for others is something she expects from her partner and rarely gets. You need to feel her feelings, her desires and needs. Be gentle, protect her even if she acts like she hates being protected and dial down the expectations. She is who she is, either you love her or you don’t. There is nothing more careless than a partner feeding off her beautiful Soul, while considering her boring and needy.\nUsuallyGeminiis something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nChoose something expensive or choose something practical for your Taurus woman. It is wrong to think that Taurus women care much about money. They actually understand its value and recognize expensive things. Taurus woman can understand the link of material value with the quantity of love when needed. Still, she will be swept off her feet by a creative, practical gift that she will be able to use. There is always a soft side to her when it comes to soaps filled with flowers, perfumes with natural scents and anything that will make her laugh. Buy her a comfortable pair of fluffy slippers or anything soft and comfortable for that matter. She needs things in her life cozy, useful and colorful.\nTake your Gemini man somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need.",

Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nVirgo woman will clean your house, cook your lunch, take care of your children, carry your suitcases and fix everything in your life with ease, unless you stop her. Please stop her. She doesn’t have to do everything on her own, all the time, but she doesn’t seem to understand this. Out of her need to help, she might make her partner feel incompetent or even stupid, and she really needs to be careful not to cross the line in criticizing or contempt.

This is what makes them great as colleagues, but this is not exactly the most important set of values a happy couple would share. Their relationship could be based on their joint business though. This would give more meaning to their conversations and everyday life.\nOther things they value don’t coincide that much. Aries is all for bravery and an attitude while Virgo thinks of these as stupid, unless they are a part of tradition or have historic significance. Virgo values intelligence while Aries thinks success has nothing to do with it and sees it as a possible reason for loneliness and sorrow. Still, these would rather be the reasons to tease each other and have a nice laugh, than they would have the capacity to tear their relationship apart.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nThere is a reason whyVirgois a sign often described as a manic cleaner. This obsession with cleaning can be projected to all activities of a Virgo woman. She wants to clean the world of evil as much as she wants to clean her teeth or the bathtub. The most important thing this woman has to face is the search for faith belief that she is better than she things she is. In most cases she is raised to not be fully aware of her beauty, goodness or value. Still, the faith in the beauty of the world and in her own fairytale will pull her with a strange gravity until she finds them. The worst thing a Virgo woman can do is settle for her rational choices, for she has the capacity for perfection in all areas of her life.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nEverything sharp, red colored and hot will be a good fit for your Aries man. If he doesn’t already have a collection, you can always buy him a Swiss knife, a set of tools, a hunter’s hat, a flame thrower or a pair of sexy boxers. He will be happy if you show how masculine and strong he is, and give him something practical to use. Don’t obsess about his presents if you will have any resulting expectations – he will never obsess about yours.\nWhen it comes to usual, expected events such as birthdays and anniversaries, don’t ever forget your Virgo woman. Buy a gift that is practical and can be used. Whether it is a piece of clothing with the appropriate message written on it or some kitchenware, her present needs to be in sync with her tidy personality. If you want to surprise her, write her a poem. She will enjoy some verses dedicated to her, and a love letter will always melt her heart. Don’t forget to check it for grammatical errors though. In most Virgo women, there is a hidden love for all sorts of art, and she might truly treasure a fine, discreet painting, or a sculpture that represents a certain message.",

Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side.

When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nTo understand Capricorn woman, you need to find a way to respect her but not take her seriously. This is a very difficult task, for she will give it her best shot to convince you that she is tough, strong, and that there is nothing she cannot handle in life. In fact, she is extremely sensitive, always shying away from her own heart, taking everything as a personal issue and sacrificing her own benefit for other people. If she doesn’t end up in a role of a victim, there is a great chance she will take on the responsibility for everyone else’s lives, and this is something you shouldn’t allow to happen.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories.

It is not easy to choose a gift for her, for she exalts Mars as much as her ruler is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus. This is why she seems to be torn up between the things she needs and the things she loves. The best choice here is to find a gift she will use, but is also beautiful and chosen by her. When she sees something hanging in the window and reacts to it, pick up the signal, return there to buy it when you are alone, and wait for her birthday, New Year’s Eve, or your anniversary to surprise her with it. The surprise will be even better if this is something she thinks too expensive or makes a rational choice not to have it, as if she settled for loving it from a distance.",

This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being.

When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

Leo is a passionate lover, warm, always in search for action and they can be quite casual when it comes to their sexual encounters. Scorpio is sex itself, and the depth of emotion that goes with it in its purest form. When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions. What Leo sees as love, Scorpio finds superficial and irritating, and what Scorpio sees as love,Leofinds depressing and irritating. They both need to give up control entirely if they want to find sexual satisfaction with each other.\nLeo woman is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.\nIt is often said that a Scorpio man can be obsessive, possessive and vindictive, but the truth is he can also be loyal, supportive, compassionate and incredible in bed. This man has to deal with unusual emotional depth, leading to his extreme sensitivity and his need to close his heart in order not to get hurt. The only reason he becomes vindictive is in his deeply emotional nature and his incapability to forgive the depth of his injuries. He may seem fatalistic, as if everything was too big to handle, for he is intense and observes life as a series of small deaths, unworthy of living unless it is lived.",

        "text": "Both of these partners will value honesty and clarity. Although they understand clarity in different directions and depth, the main characteristics in people they wish to date are very similar. Often, they won’t even recognize their similarity out of an emotionally unstable or obsessively stable position, completely different from a passionate, creative one. They have to deal with the value of creation against the value of destruction and this is not easily reconciled. The bridge between them is found in unconditional honesty.\nLeo woman is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.\nTo understand a Scorpio, you need to understand just how emotional he is. Often his sensitivity asks for a partner that is slow and tender enough. This is why this man will often end up with other Water element representatives or even better – Earth signs. He is on the hunt for the love of his life, someone to die with, or die for, and if this is not you, he will probably end your relationship before it even started. There is a feel to him that comes out of his connection to Pluto, the ruler of the Underworld, and even the most positive, optimistic Scorpios have this tendency to observe things from their ending point. This gives them the opportunity to use the most out of life and understand the practical value of their experiences.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nThere are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow.\nA perfect present for your Scorpio man is something that he has talked about a long time ago and then forgot. He loves to be reminded of things that awakened beautiful emotions inside him, and the best thing to choose is the one he chose himself. Since this sign exalts Uranus, he will be interested in technology and computers, but usually his focus is turned to the discovery of his own depth. You can’t miss with a proper psychology book or anything that will help him understand the flow of life. Choose something that can teach him about alchemy, alternative methods of healing or an honest way to understand God. That is a much better choice than that long wanted encyclopedia on World Wars.",

The seriousness of an Aries when sex is in question is something that gives Sagittarius a strong impulse to make a joke.\nThese are two Fire signs, both very passionate, each one in their own way. Aries is passionate when it comes to action, new things and of course – naked people and specific sexual positions. Sagittarius is passionate about their cheerful personality. You have to understand that Sagittarius really only cares about their opinions, convictions and moral value. They can spend their entire life analyzing these to see if they are wrong or right and search for the universal truth. When it comes to their optimism and good mood, they passionately protect them from anything too serious or hard. If they let someone taint them, it would shake their conviction that they should always smile and find a reason to be happy.\nAlthough Aries can be a bit vain about their sexual abilities and performance, in most cases Sagittarius is able to break this wall of strict, sexual tension and lead them to a more relaxed zone where they can relax and experiment.\nRelationships are not easy to Aries in general, but Aries men have special trouble when needed to connect to their partner, feel compassion and think for two. He finds it much easier to do everything alone and finds it rare in a partner to have enough energy to follow his lead. Aries man is prone to chauvinism more than any other sign in the zodiac. It is imperative for his partner to stay independent, financially and socially, if a relationship with this man is to succeed.\nAll relationships are incredibly important to a Sagittarius woman. She loves people, believes to the point of naivety in the goodness of human kind, and won’t settle until she makes everyone around her happy. Her attempts to do so can sometimes be too pushy and unrealistic, which makes it complicated to explain to her where she went wrong and gave her trust to someone that didn’t deserve it. If you think she needs to change, it might be best to give up right now. She is capable of change and if disappointed too many times she can become more serious, less naïve and better at her judgments. Still, this won’t make her happy as she is on a mission to bring the best out of everyone, including you. The only way she can be happy with her partner, is if personal growth is guaranteed and the respect for her personality unconditional.",

In time they will both understand that Aries grows through this relationship and widens their entire system of values. When they started dating, Aries probably had this idea of honor and heroic “sweep off feet” logic. In time, they both must have realized that Sagittarius gives this idea a new step up and brings it into a world of royalty. Not only does Sagittarius value honorable and heroic people, too, but they value honorable people with blue blood that give money and food to the poor, every day.\nTheir main difference is in the fact that Aries values things concise and clear, while Sagittarius will easily disperse and go around the point for days. This can be met through their mutual value of truth, so honesty can be their cure for anything.\nAries man may seem like a brute, following his instincts and rarely using his brain, however smart he might be. Still, there is a soft side to him. If his loved one is in need of his help and support, he will show exactly how much he cares. When he feels respected and loved, he will let his guard down and seem like a cuddly bear at times.Ariesmight be ashamed to be soft, but when he feels trust, he can’t help it. There is a warm, behind the act, nature to this man, something that needs to be discovered in time and is reachable by approaching him with a lot of tenderness, however he might act.\nSagittarius woman is on a mission to make everyone’s life better. Even though she can sometimes push her opinions on people she doesn’t even know, her intentions are good and her character positive, optimistic and strong. If she doesn’t cross other people’s lines in a belief that she knows what’s best for everyone else, she can truly bring out the best those around her, especially her partner. Her mission is to make the world a better place and her beliefs shouldn’t be crushed or changed. Even though she has to find a way to stay realistic, she needs her belief in the beauty of the future intact.

If two Cancer truly find each other, they will reach for each other’s deepest emotional core within their sex life. Still, Cancer is a sign where Mars falls and it is not easy for them to have initiative. For a healthy sex life, Mars needs to be strong and these two don’t necessarily show this strength. This could lead to their emotional relationship blossoming, but no sexual chemistry between them.\nIt is a good thing they both don’t need much experience or technical knowledge in their sexual encounters, because this gives them a chance to base their sex life exclusively on emotions they have for each other. It could be boring from the perspective of some other zodiac signs, but they really won’t care if they get the confirmation they are loved through their physical contact.\nHowever, they do need someone to wake them up, motivate them and push their limits. No Cancer will be satisfied with a boring emotional life, even though they might seem that way. They will fight for their family, for intimacy and their safe haven, but they will not settle for something that doesn’t excite them at all. In order for the relationship of two of them to succeed, it would be a good idea to experiment a little and show initiative at any time they feel the least bit sexual.\nA Cancer man is sensitive to his partner’s emotions and has the need to connect on a deep level. If he was badly hurt by his family situation, there is a chance he will be too afraid to open up even with the seemingly perfect partner. He doesn’t like conflict and will in most crazy situations stay calm. When he is irritated by something, he will probably say nothing, but swallowing negative emotions might make him sick, so it is important for a Cancer to find a partner who will support his expression. He is tender and caring, will probably never forget his partner’s birthday, and could bore some of the zodiac signs crazy. If one is for adventure without emotional base or purpose, they definitely shouldn’t choose a Cancer partner.\nCancer woman has this incredible gift of compassion that allows her to understand what her partner’s going through. This can make her a very good listener because she is able to put herself in other people’s shoes. She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being. This happens because she carries that motherly instinct inside every inch of her body and wants to protect her “child” from anything evil that may come. Just in case, as if maybe their partner cannot protect themselves.

This could keep them together in a loving relationship even if they maybe didn’t seem perfect for each other in the first place.\nCancer is a man with the Sun in a sign of the heart, love from our mother, our family and our inner feeling of gratitude. Because of this, he may seem weak, or something like a forced opposite of weak, and it is important to realize how hard it can be to be a man with an accented sensitive side.

When he is well raised with a stable sense of security, this is a man anyone who is after a quiet family life would want.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this. If she is underestimated, she will probably swallow her pride and move on, but she will remain hurt for a long time. There is a deep understanding to her that all things are balanced in nature, and that everything we give comes back to us. You wouldn’t want to be her enemy, for she can use her incredible moral value and goodness to beat you in less than a minute.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nCancer man will like things with traditional or emotional value. Don’t choose anything too expensive or impractical, for he has the tendency to pile things in the basement, closet, under a bed and in his partner’s purse. A Cancer wants to receive a present that shows love, and the best choice is something that has a personal touch to it. If not, you can always go with regular presents such as clothes, ties, wallets or a perfume with a fine scent. Anything that concerns his tradition and family is probably a good choice for as long as if it’s tasteful and symbolic. He is a patriot and usually loves his country, especially the locations he is bound to by beautiful memories. If you are looking for something to really surprise your Cancer partner, buy him a plane ticket to a place he always wanted to visit. He will hardly ever expect that, but must dream of some distant destinations.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter.

He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth.

This is why their relationship might seem like a competition to ruin the relationship in the best possible way. It is hard to say who will get out of it a winner, for they will both feel lousy most of the time and be relieved that they finally separated. If they stubbornly decide they love each other too much to let each other go, both of them would probably bang their heads against a wall for years to come.\nTheir only chance of success is unconditional respect and the wideness of their views and expectations. They could truly complement each other, but only in a scenario where they would look for good in one another and highlight each other’s qualities. Unfortunately, the malefic nature of their rulers rarely allows for them to be this positive and acceptance oriented. If they got together, and whatever their story is, they should think about the things they could learn from each other instead of looking for each other’s shortcomings, and always stay out of each other’s business.",

        "text": "This is a very difficult combination of signs when it comes to sexual compatibility. Rulers of Aries and Capricorn are Mars and Saturn. These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens.\nIf Aries woman is in love, she will be faithful and always in the mood to support her partner in all his endeavors. In most cases, Aries woman has enough energy for two. This can easily be her problem. Even when she knows it would be best to let the person learn their lesson and find their own way out, she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t take over the role of savior when she has enough energy and practical sense to do so. If she is not in love, the relationship can be a rollercoaster ride, from a sexual one to a non-existing one in a matter of minutes. She needs her freedom and as soon as she feels someone shows too much emotion she is not able to answer to, she will easily end the relationship.\nIf you are looking for a man at which you can point your finger and say: “He is difficult”, that would be a Capricorn man. He is not easy to be with, as an Earth sign, nor as someone who’s Sun is ruled by Saturn. He can be too strict and his expectations might be impossible to meet. If he doesn’t find the true magic of love, he will be possessive but stubborn, without any compromises made or any flexibility. This is exactly why it is so profound and inspiring to win his heart and see him melt, change and open up for things he would never consider before he met you. When he loves someone, there is rarely anything he wouldn’t do for his loved one, and it is safe to say that he is prepared to stay with the right partner forever, and never doubt his decision, or his emotions.",

        "text": "They both value independence, clarity and honesty, and in general their system of values is not what brings problems to their relationship. Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values.\nIf Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal.\nWhen Aries woman seems too aggressive and loud, try to remember that this is just the way she talks. She expresses herself a bit different that your “regular” woman. This is actually not such a bad thing because you will always know what’s on her mind. It is sometimes hard for her to recognize her emotions and she can easily lose patience for herself and others, but if you give her space to solve her issues on her own, any conflict will be avoided. There is a deep, warm emotional nature to her and a lot of energy she likes to give away to people she loves. It is important not to take her for granted and understand her efforts to make your life better.\nIt is not easy to understand a Capricorn man. He seems to be cold and distant, way too rational and critic, but we rarely stop to realize that he is actually afraid of failure, strict toward himself and always trying to remain in control. He doesn’t want to make a mistake, for he understands the consequences of any action better than anyone else. This makes him cautious, careful not to challenge karma and focused on himself and his practical goals that give him the idea he has life under control. He builds walls in order to stay protected, either sabotaged, scolded or even left by his father, or other influential role models. When you get to know him and see his soft side behind these walls, you will never want to be without him again.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nAries woman likes practical gifts with clear colors and a simple cut. Everything she wears needs to show her sexuality in a clear and a non-offensive way. Jewelry is a tricky territory since she will either not like it at all, or wear a lot of it. However, make it expensive and discreet, she will treasure it as a sign of your affection. You can always buy her a single red rose, or a hundred of them, but any flowers with a strong scent and a lot of character will do. When she accepts your gift, there is a tiny possibility she will not know how to react. Don’t misunderstand this for a lack of gratitude. Instead, surprise her often. Be it her favorite lipstick, skis, rollerblades or a massage that is paid for, stay focused on her physical needs and never forget her birthday.\nAlways respect special occasions and be as practical as you can. Capricorn man can surprise by his openness for all sorts of weird things, but before you get to know him, it is best to stick to the traditional, historical, educational, useful gifts that can last for a very long time. He has an understanding for art with a lot of detail, small but expensive signs of affection, and likes things neat and to the point. Choose a present that makes sense, that’s probably the best way to put it.",

The sign of Pisces is a culmination of a sexual encounter – orgasm. This is a place where Venus is exalted, magical, mysterious and unbelievably satisfying for Taurus’ ruler. They have the ability to get lost in each other, make their dreams come true and satisfy each other by pure existence.\nWhen it comes to sex, Taurus can easily end up in a rut if their partner isn’t inspiring or creative enough. They don’t even care, for as long as their emotional needs are met and their physical body respected. Pisces on the other hand, get lost in sexual experiences, and can even find them toxic if their impressions on other people are unrealistic. When they meet the right Taurus partner, they can be intrigued and relieved by their nature, for what they see is actually what they get.\nBecause of the emotional nature of the sign of Pisces and their deep sense of purpose,Tauruswill feel loved to the point of getting lost in the sexuality of their partner. They will both pay very little attention to their own pleasure because of all those feelings guiding them. This is almost always a giving relationship where both partners are equally satisfied when it comes to sex.\nIt is imperative for a Taurus man to move. He has a strange need to lie around all day long and eat what someone else prepares for him, with a strong tendency to become his partner’s “spoiled son” instead of a lover. This is not a rule, but there is a phase in every Taurus’ life when they’d rather do nothing. The most important thing for them is to get out of the house every day. This is easy when the relationship is new, for it will give him enough energy and motivation to be creative and interesting, as Venus should be. However, when a Taurus man starts living with someone, he has to stay on the move. If not, he can become so static that even he would be bored by himself.\nIn a relationship, Pisces man will be devoted for as long as there is strong excitement over emotions he feels. His relationships don’t last very long unless his partner accepts his romantic impulse and finds a way to create a stable foundation for their relationship to last. He will not be very reliable and agreements with him could change on an hourly basis. This can be annoying or exciting, but the only possible way to deal with it is to be spontaneous and let him choose the direction, however chaotic it might seem.",

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other.\nTaurus is a complicated man with a strong emotional side that is to be incorporated in a masculine world around him. He can often feel inadequate because of this tenderness he is aware of, and sometimes tries very hard to get rid of his soft side although it is one of his biggest qualities. When he is sad, he will hide his feelings from the rest of the world and maybe even from people closest to him. He needs a lot of tenderness and patience to become someone’s perfect man.\nHowever social he might seem, a Pisces man is a loner. He needs to spend some time with his thoughts and experiences and if he doesn’t have a chance to do so, he will be driven crazy. Although he will be ready to take on any possible adventure, he will also like to spend some time at home, doing something creative that reminds him who he is. He has a great need to express his creativity. Every Pisces man is a man on a mission, and he has to know that when he is gone, he will leave something behind. There are often too many expectations he sets for himself and he can have trouble meeting any of them, getting lost in irrelevant things to avoid dealing with his own inner disappointment.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nIf you want an easy solution, buy your Taurus man something practical like a cotton T shirt or a pair of trousers. Also, the sign ofTaurusis connected to food and the sense of taste, so many Taurus representatives like to spend some time in the kitchen. This is why any interesting kitchenware can be a good fit in case he already discovered how much he likes to cook. If you really want to make your Taurus man happy, put on a sexy apron, prepare a romantic dinner and bake a chocolate cake with his name written in colorful letters.\nA Pisces man likes attention given behind the gift. He wants to feel loved and cherished, and this can be done by creating anything to express how you feel. He is not someone who wants to get a book for his birthday, or a technical gadget he will not be able to use. He wants something more personal, something that doesn’t require analysis, and something he can feel. You can always go with soft materials, things he can touch and smell, for his senses to awaken. This is a man who will appreciate a drawing as much as a soft piece of clothing, or a pair of socks, for as long as attention is being given and he feels appreciated.",

This could easily lead to a struggle for supremacy and a battle to reach the ruling position among them. This comes as a continuation of Libra’s bruised Sun and a Sagittarius will fit in perfectly with the need to give away every sense of pride out of some childish convictions. The only way for them to be happy together, is to respect each other fully and let each other do what they are meant to do.

They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\nWith a bruised ego, a Libra man can act like a little, insulted child. It takes a lot of effort and lucky family circumstances in his life, for him to be aware that not everything is a personal insult intended to hurt him. Whatever the situation in the insult department, this is a man who will stay in a relationship for a long time if he decides to be with someone. He will not give up at the first sight of difficulty and he will trust his feelings without a doubt. In most situations he will remain calm and try to show a just way to resolve any issue in his partner’s life or their relationship. When he obsessively gives in, thinking he found the love of his life, there is a great chance he will put too much focus on his partner lacking the ability to turn to himself and build his own life.\nSagittarius man is simply not stable. It might be offensive to say that a Sagittarius man is unreliable, but this is the closest to the truth when it comes to his relationships. He might be perfectly reliable on a daily basis, but who’s to say how his feelings will develop tomorrow or in just a couple of hours?Sagittariusis a mutable sign, and the element of Fire gives this man enough speed in his changes that he seems hard to contain. Still, when he finds himself in a relationship with a partner who can follow his pace, there is a great chance he will become committed, faithful and unusually stable.

Libra doesn’t seem like a creative person to others, but a Sagittarius sees their intellect through communication and motivates them to show their warmth. This leads to shared value of their entire relationship and an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. Even if they don’t start their relationship in the same place, they will have the opportunity to build similar values in time, showing each other what’s truly important.\nLibra man is not easy to understand. His role in the world is to find general balance and you have to see how tough an assignment this is. He has to judge, show us the weight of our Souls and give in to absolute justice. Too much responsibility makes him incredibly indecisive, for he understands what many of us don’t – his responsibility for each decision he makes and the set of consequences that might follow. His ego is bruised and his priorities seem to be shuffled, while he might be lost on his own character and wishes, just out of a need to please others. In order to find peace, this man needs to break all his dependencies, be able to be alone, and leave any image or an opinion people might have about him without fear. He needs to become aware of who he is without the influence of others.\nSagittarius men are often misconstrued to be superficial and childish. Whoever wishes to form a quality relationship with this man needs to understand that the sign of Sagittarius is a continuance of Scorpio while preceding Capricorn, so there can really be nothing superficial about it. This is the man in search for truth and he won’t rest until he finds it. This doesn’t just mean he seeks honesty in his partners, but his own honest inner feelings. Most often he doesn’t even know why he doesn’t want to remain in the same relationship, or why he needs that much change and adventure. This doesn’t stop anyone around him to understand that this is because of his search for that one, true direction. He wants to find the place of absolute synthesis and truth, and only when he finds it with one person, will he remain faithful and committed to them.\nGIFT FOR PARTNER\nLibra man will probably want something expensive. Even if he doesn’t seem like a material type, a set of fancy headphones, an expensive professional camera or shoes that you’d never by at that price, will make him feel valued and proud. He always wants something that looks fancy, with simple lines and an even boringly moderate shape and set of colors. So go for beige, grey or black and white if you aren’t certain of his preferences. Some moderate green might come in handy too. The perfect gift for him needs to fit his size and his mind. It needs to stimulate his intellect or be truly beautiful and tasteful. It doesn’t have to be practical at all, for as long as is inspires him through beauty or real creativity.\nThere is nothing easier than buying a plane ticket for your Sagittarius man. To any destination. He will be satisfied with the bus ticket too, but if he gets a chance to fly, his gratitude will multiply greatly. He likes things big and colorful, even when you see him only in black, beige and grey. You can always choose a book of jokes, funny things children say, philosophy and the search for truth. He will value a useless present if it is absurd enough, so go with a traffic sign for his apartment or something similar he thinks he’d never get.",

Still, there is a link between them, pretty strong for that matter. Cancer continues the sign ofGemini, and in a way their nature is a consequence of endless conversations and rational explanations.\nIf Gemini partner has enough patience to talk to their partner about same things over and over, in time they could build enough intimacy to have a good sex life. In order for this scenario to develop, Cancer needs to talk, too. It will not be enough to say a sentence or two and expect that their Gemini will understand how they feel. If they manage to communicate, Cancer could actually wake the depth of their Gemini, giving them enough support to express their more emotional sexual personality.\nIf they want their relationship to work, their sex life needs to be somewhere in the middle – intimate enough and exciting enough – for both partners to be satisfied.\nGemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long.

She has the need to protect people she loves and this can be a bit overexaggerated and strange when you look at her as a gentle being.

Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.\nAs all cardinal signs, a Cancer woman has a mission to make a huge change in her life. If she chooses Scorpio or Aquarius partners, we can conclude that she hasn’t made that change yet, and from these partners she can learn how. She is actually very strong and as all mothers, ready to give her life for the ones she loves. Although she might seem too mellow and soft, she is a true fighter when motivated and needs her partner to understand this.

She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds.\nCancer woman likes a gift with sentimental value. It is best to choose it by listening to her words and sensing her reactions to things. If you see that she’s got excited about something she saw in the window of a shop, go in and buy that exact thing. She will not care about specific occasions if you show understanding for her emotional reactions and needs that form along the way. Still, it is best to show respect for tradition, and if she always got flowers for her birthday, it is a good thing to buy flowers each year. However, her need to value tradition is not something she will hold on to over emotion, so try to choose something practical, not too expensive and most importantly, something that feels like her.",

[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds.

It will be demonstrated whether a potential relationship is working or not.","interp":"With the Eight of Swords in this position, you are being investigated in some way. This rigorous scrutiny could feel a little bit like an inquisition. In one sense it's a challenge to prove that you are a master of your medium. Refuse to take any of it personally. Intellectually, you must sharpen your thinking, your sword of truth, in order to answer your possible partner or others.\nAs your design or idea is being questioned and dissected, you may be asked to justify each and every detail. Consider this card a reality check. Does your concept or ideal stand up well to scrutiny? If you can safely navigate this minefield you will emerge on the other side, proud of how well you maintained your integrity under duress.","interp_general":"Often called \"the Test,\" the Eight of this suit usually pictures a warrior running the gauntlet, subjected to harsh examination, who finds out just how tough he is (or isn't) in the process. Life provides us with plenty of experiences that put us in situations of close scrutiny -- whether it's an entrance exam, a decisive job interview or even the tough conversations that follow upon a breach of trust in a close relationship.\nSometimes the challenge or obstacle course has nothing to do with other people, as when an inventor has to face the question \"Does it really work?\" or when the aspirant has to decide how badly he desires to go through some sort of initiation. This card shows what happens to that great idea in real time, where the rubber meets the road. The Test represents your chance to vindicate the time and energy spent in getting ready for a big moment. In most cases, you will either pass or fail, with little in the way of available middle ground.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":57},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about.

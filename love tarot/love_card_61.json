[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"When you answer a relationship challenge, prepare for the consequences.","interp":"The Knight of Swords (in some decks, a Prince) in this position symbolizes a warrior getting ready to defend a matter of principle. You are either feeling challenged or feeling a need to put your foot down. In effect, you are strapping on your armor and sharpening your blade. Whoever tangles with you now faces a daunting opponent, because a righteous indignation empowers the character of this card. Hopefully your cause is worth what lies ahead.\nSometimes this Prince becomes so eager for the fight that he forgets what it will cost his or her partner, as well as how many other lives may be affected. Before you commit yourself to further action and reaction, be sure you are ready for all the consequences to your potential relationship that you could stimulate by taking a strong position.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince. Traditionally, this card portrays the restless mind, aroused by thoughts of offense and defense, storming around searching for a target to pounce on. He often feels slighted, has a chip on his shoulder and bristles with a hostile attitude. His usual method is to look for someone to blame for his irritation.\nFurthermore, in an attitude of righteousness, he may assign himself the job of correcting the offender. Jumping easily to conclusions, he shoots first, asks questions later and is therefore often guilty of overkill. This is not to say that he does not have his heroic side; a single-minded combativeness can have its value. However, even when he is doing the right thing, he is likely to be doing it for the wrong reasons. Apt advice for this card is to deeply question your motives for what you are thinking about doing. Forethought will assist you in discriminating between righteous and unrighteous causes. Control any traces of impulsive judgement!\nOccasionally you will notice in the detail on the card, that the person can be a woman rather than the expected man. There is some evidence that the tradition of knighthood included a certain number of \"anonymous knights\" who took mythic names and veiled their true identities. Living on the road with few or no servants, they served as free-lance defenders of travelers, champions of the little people against the exploitation of both highway robbers and the wealthy classes. Odds are that some of these knights-errant were camouflaged women, and that idea is preserved with the traditional representation of the Sword Knight.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":61},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"When you can't find a reason for the conflict that is emerging, look for the opportunity it may present.","interp":"The Knight of Swords (in some decks, a Prince) in this position represents a person who may be preparing to move against you. Shockingly enough, this could even be someone who is a true-blue sweetheart most of the time! Whatever the case, you may not fully understand what has provoked such a reaction. In fact, it may not even be personal. Sometimes people have time-bombs buried in their personality, and there is no predicting when they will go off. Whatever served as a fuse, use every opportunity to communicate that you meant no offense -- unless you actually did, in which case you are getting back what you gave out.\nViewed optimistically, the situation could present you with a worthy adversary who could assist you in learning how to defend your position without being intimidated. If you keep it clean and fair, you will learn about your blind spots and increase your confidence in your conflict-resolution skills, as well as your ability to trust one another. Try to see this as a chance to practice your moves and become stronger at holding your ground. In any case, there is no need to make yourself responsible for the hostilities -- the situation may have been tense before you came on the scene.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"Accept a coming challenge only if it will benefit the greater good. A potential relationship could be affected by your decision.","interp":"With the Knight (in some decks, a Prince) of Swords in this position, you may have an opportunity to experience the kind of power that comes from high idealism and strong moral sensibilities. Avoid becoming self-righteous and moralistic, but maintain your convictions. For the sake of clarity, step back and look at how your potential relationship fits into the big picture. Scrutinize your motives, making sure you are not just spoiling for a fight.\nOnly engage this challenge if it stands to benefit all those who may be affected, because a new relationship with the one you desire could take a beating if you decide to go through with it. This Prince is at his best as an intellectual and moral leader who raises others' sensibilities by choosing strategic battles that illuminate important moral or ethical issues. If this is your motive, pursue it.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince.

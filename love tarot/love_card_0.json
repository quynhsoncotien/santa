[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","position_name":"Love & Me","interp":"The Fool is associated with circumstances that are unique, unpredictable and inscrutable -- like one who is suspended between realities. The Fool is often portrayed as an empty headed simpleton unaware of the forces that move him to and fro, following his impulses. But tradition tells us that this Fool has a secret that protects him: the magic of synchronicity. He proceeds without calculation, spontaneously, without hesitation or resistance.\nIf you trust in your own mystery and that of Divine Providence, you can step into a new realm of opportunities for you and your potential love interest. For now, trust your instincts. If you have no expectations, you have nothing to lose.","card":0,"interp_general":"Pamela Coleman-Smith's artful rendition of an \"innocent Fool\" archetype (Rider-Waite deck) is often used to represent Tarot in general. Early classical versions of the Fool card, however, portray quite a different character -- a person driven by base needs and urges, who has fallen into a state of poverty and deprivation.\nIn some instances, he is made out to be a carnival entertainer or a huckster. In others, he is portrayed as decrepit and vulnerable -- as the cumulative result of his delusions and failures. Not until the 20th century do you see the popular Rider-Waite image of the Fool arise -- that of an innocent Soul before its Fall into Matter, as yet untainted by contact with society and all its ills.\nModern decks usually borrow from the Rider-Waite imagery. Most Fool cards copy the bucolic mountainside scene, the butterfly, the potential misplaced step that will send the Fool tumbling into the unknown. Don't forget, however, that the earlier versions of this card represented already-fallen humanity, over-identified with the material plane of existence, and beginning a pilgrimage towards self-knowledge, and eventually, wisdom. The Fool reminds us to recognize the path of personal development within ourselves -- and the stage upon that path where we find ourselves -- in order to energize our movement toward deeper self-realization.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"You inhabit that transitional world between the past and the future, liberated from traditional boundaries in your forthcoming relationship with your partner."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Fool is in this position, an upcoming romantic situation may be undefined and open-ended. You do not know, nor can you even begin to guess, what is happening in another person's head. This can create either a feeling of panic ... or relief, if you let it be OK. After all, having no blueprint frees you up from the pressure of expectations. You are also free to do something really foolish because there are no rules in place!\nThis is a test of your internal guidance system. Can you refrain from getting desperate about your potential relationship in the current absence of structure?","card":0,"interp_general":"Pamela Coleman-Smith's artful rendition of an \"innocent Fool\" archetype (Rider-Waite deck) is often used to represent Tarot in general.

Empty the vessel, releasing any preconceived agenda. Allow yourself and your potential lover to be guided from a still, calm place within."},{"position_header":"The Challenges position helps you get the best out of your relationship situation. it reflects the cutting edge, the learning curve whereby you can turn challenges into win\/win victories -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present  themselves. Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","position_name":"Challenges","interp":"When the Fool is in this position, you may be challenged to remain balanced and optimistic during a period of uncertainty. Because you may be momentarily free of preordained roles or titles, purposely detach yourself from the desire for them. This also suggests a potential relationship that is not limited by a predetermined course of action or the judgements of others.\nJust as everything that exists was once a seed in someone's imagination, your upcoming relationship is a seed in your own. What visions would you use to germinate its future? The Fool's bag of tricks contains many powerful dreams. Open the bag and look at what you might be carrying in the way of seed ideas.","card":0,"interp_general":"Pamela Coleman-Smith's artful rendition of an \"innocent Fool\" archetype (Rider-Waite deck) is often used to represent Tarot in general.

[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself.

How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here?

This Great Mother beckons us with her life-giving support. She is the abundant matrix from which we draw vital life and out of which we individuate.

She is Nature, around us but also within us, the ever-unfolding Source of life-giving power. She is often pictured as a pre-Christian Goddess, as the one whom the High Priestess is channeling down to earth for the rest of us.\nIn medieval Europe, the Empress card was painted to represent whatever Queen currently ruled the land, probably to satisfy the Inquisitors. But the scholars of the Renaissance and beyond had no doubt of her true identity, although she could not be fully revealed on Tarot cards as the \"woman clothed with the sun\" until after the French Revolution.\nThis supreme archetype of femininity also symbolizes fertility. It is She who provides us nourishment and security. She is also sometimes seen as delighting us with flowers and fruit. A potentially terrifying aspect of this archetype manifests itself whenever karmic mood swings wipe out our plans, like a storm that has come upon us.

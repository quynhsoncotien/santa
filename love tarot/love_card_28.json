[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds.

This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.\nThe Seven of this suit generally shows a person who is nearly always successful in working her or his will in the world. This is a person who is truly gifted, standing head and shoulders above the rest, a standard-setter and exemplar that exceeds previous conceptions of what is possible.\nIn historical Tarot, this person would most likely be portrayed as an admired and feared warrior who has vanquished his adversaries against all odds, but nowadays such an outstanding feat could just as easily apply to the world of the media, politics or business.\nBeware of creeping smugness that can be hinted at by this card. Being successful does not make you invincible, and it does not protect you against errors!

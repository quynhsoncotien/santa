[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","position_name":"Love & Me","interp":"The Two of Cups in this position is shouting \"Love!\" This isn't necessarily about a traditional love affair. It could be a strong heart connection between you and a possible partner whom you care about. It could even be an attraction to an ideal or a vision that is as real to you as any interpersonal relationship. It can also represent reconciliation between your own masculine and feminine aspects.\nIn any case, this card is referring to that aroused, emotionally sensitive space we enter when we are opening up at a deep level. This may be a sweet, adorable moment, but you can't deduce from this immediate feeling what the ultimate outcome of the relationship will be. Nevertheless, this card does encourage the idealism that creates fidelity and trust, empathy and compassion -- the very human virtues we need most in our lives and relationships. Your emotional, psychic and spiritual life are quickening like spring. Enjoy this wonderful feeling and bless the world with it, but don't make any serious commitments at this time.","card":37,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls. This card traditionally describes a romantic relationship, but also includes the idea that all good friendships and partnerships are based on a natural affinity and a deep mutual understanding. As a personal reflection, it can also signify that your mind and your soul are discovering each other, maybe for the first time.\nThis card also symbolizes a karmic tie, often portrayed by a wreath or figure eight ribbon twining around the two cups. Occasionally you see a symbol referring to the union of alchemical opposites (as in sacred sex), pictured as a long-necked flask twined with serpents -- sometimes with wings -- spouting flames. This image is from Alchemy, indicating the refining and mutually completing effect of a true and lasting love.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Feelings of renewal and idealism are arising in potential intimate relationships, which will empower you to radiate the higher virtues to all around you."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating.

This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Two of Cups is in this position, you have access to a romantic, idealistic and open-hearted  quality within yourself. Perhaps you are feeling stimulated by someone you care about. Perhaps you are just feeling romantically inclined. In either case, such a state can make you want to ignore the ordinary rules of relationship. Be careful not to completely forget what's real whenever you are in the blissful state of infatuation!\nA relationship may have the power to turn you in a whole new direction. If you feel lost, try using your empathy and intuition rather than your logical mind. On some subtle level, this card indicates an interpersonal affinity that can override superficial differences, as well as what might otherwise be perceived as obstacles. You can't expect to feel this way forever -- it's not logical. But for now, who cares?","card":37,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls.

However, you may only want to do this with that person who has earned your trust and has proven his or her loyalty. Now may not be the time to forsake your boundaries and merge with someone, even if this is what your instinct and desires are pushing you toward. You may feel completely smitten and would like to be swept off your feet -- but don't be so eager to give yourself away!\nNo relationship that is realistic will expect or demand one hundred percent surrender. Also, no healthy person would need to accept such an expectation in the name of love. It's not required that you rescue anyone or that you be rescued. Neither do you need to risk everything for another. Give up dramatic agendas. It may be more important that you meet half way, with hearts open, and get to know each other better.","card":37,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls.

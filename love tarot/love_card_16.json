[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Significant change is brought about rapidly and unexpectedly in the relationship between your and your possible love interest.","interp":"The Tower represents an explosive charge that is unplanned and uncontrollable but presents a brilliant opportunity for transformation in your forthcoming relationship. Because of circumstances beyond your control, you may have no choice.\nTry not to judge whether this development is good or bad. You won't know for awhile whether this was the worst disaster that ever happened or a significant breakthrough. It could be a combination of both.","interp_general":"In practically all renditions of the Tower card, disaster is striking or has just struck. The demons of madness and despair are released from ancient hiding places, and nature conspires with human failings to destabilize a society. The upheaval is collective and impersonal. Let us remember these images were created for the educated nobles and clergy -- reminding them that they have the most to lose if the hierarchy is toppled.\nLightning is a fitting karmic payback for the guilt of those whose fortunes come from the exploitation or abuse of others. A modern subtitle might be \"Revolution,\" indicating that through drastic social change oppressed people can find renewed hope of better times. The Tower experience comes like a flash of lightning to topple the hierarchy of the old order, after which everyone can have a fresh start on a more equal footing.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":16},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about.

The manner of its appearance may come as a shock and until the tension breaks, neither you nor your possible partner feels totally secure. This is not just something between the two of you. Rather, the event may be happening all around you. The apparent cause could be a sudden event or a product of accumulation over time. At any rate, the highly charged situation may be currently at critical mass.\nIf there's the slightest shift in the energy, then conditions could become unrestrained. Stay alert and vigilant. The person who you would like to become involved with may be in need of your assistance at this crucial moment.","interp_general":"In practically all renditions of the Tower card, disaster is striking or has just struck.

When the lightning strikes, most people feel fearful of their ability to assimilate the impact of sudden, forceful change in a relationship - especially if it's a new one. A few other people may go into overdrive -- they feel enlivened, creative, more intelligent and intuitive than usual. It all depends on your ability to sustain shock and carry the charge.\nPrepare yourself to ensure that you are well grounded, as well as psychologically open and flexible. In this way, you may leverage some of the positive force of this energy when it's released. This way you may experience the least amount of negative kickback.","interp_general":"In practically all renditions of the Tower card, disaster is striking or has just struck.

What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior.

How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds.

He's the sacrificial lamb, whether it's accepted with grace or only because it's been forced upon him. In either case, his ordeal serves to clear the air of general tension, denial and game playing. The Hanged Man's predicament brings issues to a head, making it possible to clear the slate and allow everyone to start over.\nWhether it's purely symbolic or has to do with real events between you and a potential partner, it clears the collective conscience and helps to break old patterns. It's a good thing that you are the one playing this vulnerable role, and not someone else who might be broken by the experience. You are resilient and regenerative, someone who can view this experience as educational and not be totally victimized by it. This is the enlightened attitude. Your sacrifice will make a difference in the larger flow of events, even if it's not fair and you don't deserve it.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card known as the Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action. This energy is arrested and awaiting judgment. With this card, there is no avenue for the will to regain control until the situation has passed.\nThis represents a good time to be philosophical, to study and meditate upon the position you find yourself in, and form resolutions for the moment you become free again.

This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"You or your possible love interest must admit their mistake and apologize to relieve the situation of stress and unsettled feelings.","interp":"The Hanged Man in this position indicates a lesson being learned about taking advantage of each other. The potential relationship will feel tense, difficult, and blocked until each person becomes conscious of their part and agrees to make changes. In a growing love relationship, it is almost certain that periodically one person will do something that makes the other question everything about the relationship's potential. Knowing those odds, you must stop expecting to be seen as perfect. When it is reported that you have transgressed and are causing real pain to your potential beloved's heart, you must apologize and make amends with composure and dignity in the way of the warrior. Sometimes you have to take some hits and accept some correction for the sake of the relationship.\nThere is no moral stain on those who find themselves in this position. But it is tempting fate to think that anyone is immune to this possibility. The ordeal will have been worth it if it brings the participants, including yourself, to a new point of view and release from the past.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card known as the Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action.

Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"When forced into a potential relationship where you can only observe events unfold, how can you be held responsible for the results?","interp":"The Hanged Man card in this position challenges you to use periods of censure and helplessness to study a forthcoming relationship in detail. These kinds of predicaments release you from the obligations and responsibility of being in control. Instead, you may serve as witness to what happens when vindictive types get their hands on the wheel.\nThe best and most prudent course may be for you to stay neutral and learn from the temporary periods of chaos that follow mob psychology. When one is caught short and strung up, he or she can't be blamed for what comes next. Forgiveness may be a wise and useful companion in such a situation.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card known as the Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action.

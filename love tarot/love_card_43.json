It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior.

How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds.

Apparently you are strong enough to gain greater strength and wisdom from this challenging relationship experience. Don't sink into self-pity. It's not easy to pick yourself up, process the experience and come through it stronger and wiser than before -- but you can do it.","interp_general":"The Eight of this suit is often used to signify a disappointment, emotional setback, betrayal or injury to the heart. Some cards illustrate this principle by showing a young woman who has just been molested and then cast aside by a stranger passing through her village.\nHis heartless act has left her vulnerable, with potentially drastic consequences.

One of you may have chosen to follow a pattern of unequal treatment that unduly benefits the other and which will ultimately undermine trust. You may have also witnessed this trend in relations with others and are wondering how long it will be before your current relationship repeats the pattern. A moral decision is now in your hands. Do you let sleeping dogs lie and act as if nothing has happened? Or, do you directly question the other person, risking a difficult communication or even worse?\nYou can ignore the truth for only so long, if the other person is going too far. Don't lose your self-respect or your admiration for the other. Set a boundary now. Avoiding possible negative reactions that could result if you confront the problem head-on would be a mistake. It's time to stop going along for the sake of getting along. Get more clarity. Restore some balance, which could only benefit both of you and the relationship's potential for growth.","interp_general":"The Eight of this suit is often used to signify a disappointment, emotional setback, betrayal or injury to the heart.

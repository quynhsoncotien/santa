[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here?

Don't let this distract you from the necessary responsibilities of day to day relationship survival, however.\nThis energy sometimes allows itself to be swept away. In a slight trance, he may grant too much power and credibility to gurus, romantic partners, or leaders when it's really in his best interest to keep his own counsel. With a dreamy heart on his sleeve, utterly sincere and transparent in his motives, he assumes everyone else is a seeker, too. Beware forgetting to look out for yourself lest you be played for a fool.","card":46,"interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess.

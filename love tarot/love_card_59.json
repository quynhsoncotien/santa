[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","position_name":"Love & Me","interp":"The Ten of Swords in this position signifies a sense of grim relief. At this point you are no longer obligated to exert any more effort because there is nothing more you can do. Under the circumstances, no one can rationally expect you to have any power to change the situation.\nIn a sense, you are free. You may be in shock and your ego may have been deflated a bit, but that is understandable and acceptable. It may be best not to try to do anything about any relationship right now. This card gives you permission to surrender to the inevitable. Be assured that in time you will recover, that you will again have some wind behind your sails. For the present, you're just knocked out. Admit it and go with it -- what else can you do?","card":59,"interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents finality, the end of something. As is easy to grasp from the picture in many decks, there is no hope for revival here. A limit has been reached, a line has been crossed and there is no turning back. In some situations this may be felt as a tragic loss, but it often brings with it a paradoxical sense of release and closure. The waiting and wondering are over. There is no more ambiguity. You can rightly let go and move on, as there is no more progress to be made here.\nEmotionally and psychologically, this card appears when one is exhausted and used up, burnt out by the effort of caring and responding and trying to make a difference. When a person feels this way, they have reached burnout and can no longer be held responsible for anything, and therefore can be forgiven for caving in or ceding the fight. The simple instructions are: \"Go no further along these lines!\"","position_int":1,"interp_header":"You are down and out with regard to a potential relationship, and it is appropriate to admit it."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Ten of Swords is in this position, a potential relationship seems to be failing and losing ground. Harmony has been disrupted and replaced with a certain amount of chaos. All is not lost for either of you, or the possible relationship, but it is a radical shakeup of the prevailing order. Your influence may be too small to repair things, especially if strong divisive forces are dominant right now.\nSince you have no control over the outcome, why spend energy trying so hard? Sometimes all you can do is wait things out. Rely on the good sense nature gave you and save your energies for a new start when the time is right. It's good to know when to cut your losses and detach yourself from circumstances. If you do so, you might not have to go down with the ship.","card":59,"interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents finality, the end of something.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","position_name":"Challenges","interp":"The Ten of Swords in this position is reminding you to know when to cut your losses. You need to tap the good sense Nature gave you. This could mean letting go of a relationship possibility, accepting that it cannot bear positive fruit. Or it could mean going through hell for a while, for the sake of maintaining a connection. In either case, certain lines of development may not be worth pursuing right now, no matter what promises or expectations may have been made.\nIf outrageous developments have negated agreements or expectations, there can come a time when there is no advantage in traveling that road any longer. It's like the system has crashed and the progress you thought you had made has been lost. The lesson is to know when and how to skillfully detach yourself from an unhealthy situation or relationship. There's no reason to go down with the ship. He or she who avoids a battle will live to strive another day!","card":59,"interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents finality, the end of something.

[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Consider carefully what consequences may result from joining forces with your next romantic partner.","interp":"The Five of Coins in this position indicates the attraction of opposites. The Five of Coins depicts lovers discovering each other, mirroring and matching, magnetized by each other's qualities. Once the first flush of infatuation is past, however, the same energy of attraction that once felt so exciting may become a source of friction. The seeds of conflict are built into the fabric of the attraction. Even though the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts, it has been known to devour the individuals who comprise it.\nThis card suggests a potential relationship opportunity or offer. Examine what the outcome of joining forces would be. Ascertain as best you can if there is enough to keep you and your possible partner engaged, so that you don't base a long-term endeavor on a moment's infatuation. Successful long-term partnerships are business arrangements as well as love affairs.\nIn the English-school decks, the sickly poor freezing outside a well-lit church warn of the painful outcomes of bad choices, rather than focusing on the dynamic tension of the choosing itself, as in the traditional Continental decks.","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource. - The Five of this suit is the card of desire and gratification, expressed in classical tradition as flattery and false promises. This card represents both the seducer and the one seduced. There is undeniable excitement in the attraction of opposites; we have all had delightful moments of magnetism with a stranger. However, if promises are only spoken to achieve short-term gratification with no intent of follow-through, or the attraction appears as competition to more fulfilling relationships, the long-term result won't be worth the thrill of the chase. - The appearance of a viable relationship does not always bear out, so don't put anything of real value at risk over an infatuation. Since the suit here is Coins, this is as likely to be related to business as to pleasure. Try to remove the influence of glamour from your thinking. - Note: In the English decks, like the Rider-Waite, the sickly poor freezing outside a well lit church warn of the painful outcomes of bad choices, rather than focusing on the dynamic tension of the choosing itself, as in the traditional Continental decks.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":68},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"Romantic exhilaration about a possible relationship could sidetrack you from attending to practical matters. Remember, there may be gaps between what is being said and what will ultimately be done.","interp":"When the Five of Coins is in this position, a potential relationship involves emotional or financial risks as well as great possible rewards. The structure of your new arrangement is up in the air. This is probably not a good time to make a lot of emotional promises or to listen to them either. There may be a danger that you will be swept up by the excitement of the moment and neglect practical details that will determine your future. Do not discount your magical feelings. However, be sure to ask the difficult questions. Make someone earn your trust, instead of just giving it away.\nNote: In the English-school decks, like the Rider-Waite, the sickly poor freezing outside a well-lit church warn of the painful outcomes of bad choices, rather than focusing on the dynamic tension of the choosing itself, as in the traditional Continental decks.","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential.

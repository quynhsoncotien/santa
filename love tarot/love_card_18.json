[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Layers of illusion are removed. Your essential self is disclosed in relation to your possible love interest.","interp":"With the Moon in this position, you are cast into your deepest unknown. Not to be seen as either bad or good, this is an opportunity to penetrate your inner life. You may be familiar with this experience or you may never have experienced it before in your life. You are moving between worlds, shifting and modifying. Reality changes from hour to hour. Your rational mind has deserted you, leaving instinct and intuition as your guides, especially in your forthcoming relationship. All the architecture of civilization has been stripped from your personality and you are naked unto yourself.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Moon card refers to a deep state of sensitivity and imaginative impressionability, developed within a womb of deep relaxation. Here we dream and go into trance, have visions and receive insights, wash in and out with the psychic tides, and experience deep mystical and\/or terrifying realities beyond our ordinary senses. The full moon and\/or eclipse cycle charted by the Magi (as in some of the earliest Moon card images) exemplify this as a mechanism that Nature uses to expand consciousness.\nThe variants of the courtly lovers (representing skillful use of the sex force) or the man sleeping it off under the tree (use of drugs to alter consciousness) are also traditional avenues for tapping this primal force. Human interest in higher states propels us to the frontiers of consciousness, where we cannot always control what happens. The Moon card represents the ultimate test of a soul's integrity, where the membrane between self and the Unknown is removed, and the drop of individuality reenters the Ocean of Being. What transpires next is between a soul and its Maker.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":18},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"Stay fluid. Refuse to believe that anything in your forthcoming relationship is as it appears.","interp":"When the Moon is in this position, the power dynamic in your potential relationship may be changing. Nothing is quite as it seems. Both you and the one you want to be involved with are caught up in your own version of reality, insisting that your truth is the only one. Distortions abound, and fear rules the day. This is not the best time for gaining clarity. It may be best to slink into the shadows and wait the situation out. If you feel compelled to navigate this landscape, stay clear of extremes.\nTake the middle course through this segment of your journey and maintain an objective outlook. Release any preconceptions you have. They no longer work with the current agenda. Stay alert and you can avoid getting pulled into any hidden emotional vortexes -- especially those of your own making!","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Moon card refers to a deep state of sensitivity and imaginative impressionability, developed within a womb of deep relaxation.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"You are not adrift. You can skillfully navigate this extraordinary experience as you gain knowledge of a potential relationship.","interp":"The Moon in this position indicates a challenge to retain a modicum of self-consciousness while you sink deeply into your primal nature. As happens at full moon, something has loosened the floodgates of the collective unconscious. Accordingly, you may be as aware of the high tide as much as anyone can be. Trust that your good reflexes will respond appropriately to what your sensors tell you is going on around you in your new relationship.\nWhen reason is eclipsed by feelings, your natural and psychic intelligence may provide a safety net. Once the floodgates of the unconscious are opened, you will be self-preserving and sensitive, leaving behind old patterns. You will gain new, intuitive knowledge of your coming relationship situation, and be able to use this to set new standards.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Moon card refers to a deep state of sensitivity and imaginative impressionability, developed within a womb of deep relaxation.

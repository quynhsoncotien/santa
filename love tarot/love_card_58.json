[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Take time to honor your feelings as you heal from devastating circumstances. Allow yourself to look forward to future relationships with optimism.","interp":"The Nine of Swords in this position portrays a person suffering the lonely grief of abandonment or bereavement, and perhaps a sense of panic due to loss of power and position. Overcome with feelings of helplessness, he or she is beset with fear of what might happen next. But no matter what may have happened in current or past relationships, all meaning is not lost from life.\nYou can and will recover from setbacks. To do so, you must overcome pessimism. As you recover from misfortune, you will see the way clear before you. Give yourself time to explore your feelings, and you will awaken tomorrow with confidence in the future.","interp_general":"The Nine of this suit has a special resonance with the Middle Ages, because it figures the plight of a woman who is alone in the world, during the centuries when women had no personal rights, no ability to inherit property or use the law in their own defense. We generally see her sitting up in bed weeping, grieving and in fear of abandonment because of her vulnerability, wondering what will happen to her now that her protector (father, brother, husband, or son) is gone.\nThe swords above her head may indicate that the loss has come through some cruel conflict, the outcome of which has left her behind as chattel, the spoils of war. Really what we are looking at is the price of pride, which creates losers as a side effect of glorifying winners. The woman in the picture represents the concerns of the heart, the damage to the soul and to vulnerable ones, when the ego-mind becomes so invested in control and domination that it does not count the human costs. A sensitive, subtle, heartfelt approach to nature (the \"feminine\") is trampled and thrown aside in service to a \"winner takes all\" mentality.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":58},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"Although difficulties and painful feelings may surround you, you can choose not to be swept up by them.","interp":"The Nine of Swords in this position points to some kind of a tragic loss. Although it may not impact you individually, the emotional impact of this blow does have an effect on a significant potential relationship. Objectivity and optimism seem to have flown out the window.\nAlthough you may share some of the shock and grief of a future partner, you can choose not to succumb to feelings of desperation and hopelessness. It is important to remember this even if your loved one is feeling very down. The stability you have to offer this person during such a difficult time will long be remembered. You can support the healing process by keeping a clear head.","interp_general":"The Nine of this suit has a special resonance with the Middle Ages, because it figures the plight of a woman who is alone in the world, during the centuries when women had no personal rights, no ability to inherit property or use the law in their own defense.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too.

Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"A difficult relationship that brings sorrow may also give rise to feelings of liberation.","interp":"With the Nine of Swords in this position you may be facing a paradox that illustrates how that which causes grief and sorrow may also produce a great release. Sometimes the catastrophe you fear the worst may actually be the end of an impossible or difficult relationship. If this is one of those times, consider the possibility that binding obligations to a past -- be it a relationship or situation -- may now be ended.\nIf this is so, then you may now be free to choose your own direction, to explore and grow beyond circumstances that previously hemmed you in. The very fact that this may be happening indicates your readiness to make this transition. Somewhere beneath the distress and loss is a reserve of strength that has been building for this kind of opportunity. Point yourself toward healing and liberation. Free from suffering, you can focus on the positive. Collect visions and ideas that will help you rise above feelings of hopelessness. Let go of the past and let your spirit soar!","interp_general":"The Nine of this suit has a special resonance with the Middle Ages, because it figures the plight of a woman who is alone in the world, during the centuries when women had no personal rights, no ability to inherit property or use the law in their own defense.

It's fine to enjoy nostalgia and sentimentality, but when you have finished refreshing yourself in the waters of memory, come back to the present with energy for a new intimate relationship, where your scope is so much broader.","interp_general":"The Six of this suit generally represents a refreshing openness and innocence, a willingness to learn and an optimism that things will get better as we advance together in understanding.

It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior.

This card reminds you to use the powers of your mind to steer that wild excitement and focus the energy, because the urge to action is unstoppable. When you take up the reins of the charioteer, you assume the rapid rise of the culturally, psychologically and technologically advanced and mobile individual, a world class citizen.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card usually entitled the Chariot points to a triumphal feeling of freedom, as if the charioteer is being paraded through the streets as a hero (or heroine). The card reflects congratulations for high achievement, and serves as a sign of empowerment.\nHuge wheels and frisky steeds speed the rate at which the driver's willpower can be realized. This kind of charge makes more of the world accessible to anyone ambitious enough to seize the Chariot's reins.

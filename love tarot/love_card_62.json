[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"This is a good time to assert your individuality. Even a partner must step aside as you move forward in your own life.","interp":"When the Queen of Swords comes up in this position, it is a time to become more autonomous. This queen has learned through challenging experience that she should be her own best friend. She doesn't need to be rescued, \"helped\" or patronized. As such, it's time to set boundaries as you move your emotional and psychic centers back to yourself.\nIn the old tradition, the Queen of Swords was stigmatized as unwanted, a woman who had outlived her usefulness to a man. Nowadays wise and independent people with maturity are better appreciated. Today we celebrate her as a self-defined individual and understand her as a person who owns herself. She fosters no dependencies because she craves none. In this way she is freer to move in the world unencumbered by the entangling expectations of others. When the time arrives, it may be more beneficial to become less available to a new partner's whims. Strike out on your own. Win or lose on your own merits.","interp_general":"Representing the energy of a Queen, this feminine power was traditionally known as a widow, crone or divorcee. In modern times, she can be viewed as a model of self-sufficiency, independence and intelligence. She often has extremely high standards due to her subtle sensitivities, which can be perceived by those around her as being critical or hard to please. Her true motive is to refine the world, to upgrade peoples' understanding -- so that everyone can have the space they need to become fully themselves.\nShe is not interested in conforming. She is too intelligent to be confined to the role of housewife or nursemaid, although she is perfectly competent in those areas. She chooses her associations (or her solitude), and is seldom caught up in dependent relationships -- at least not for long. Her intelligence is not always the most comfortable to be around, but she can be counted on to see through superficiality and point to the truth of a situation.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":62},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"A possible relationship can no longer be forced to work. Change persists despite one's preferences.","interp":"The Queen of Swords is in this position indicates a release from what could have been a close relationship. The overall feeling is one of detachment. Certain ideas have surfaced which emphasize differences between you and your possible partner. The basis for cultivating the relationship may be in question ... so, naturally there may be a change in the quality of interaction.\nWhat used to be a river of feeling between you may now be a trickle -- barely enough to cling to or be sentimental about. You may need some space to be alone now. Think of it as you would a change of season. The situation or environment you are in is becoming dormant and the temperature is dropping into frosty zones. You may need to thicken your skin or put on a few more layers of emotional padding. Why allow yourself to be injured during a climactic shift? It is not really about you anyway. It may simply be about change.","interp_general":"Representing the energy of a Queen, this feminine power was traditionally known as a widow, crone or divorcee.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"Champion your own needs. Put some distance between yourself and one who would hamper your progress.","interp":"With the Queen of Swords in this position, improve your ability to balance your needs against the pressures of expectations from a possible romantic interest. This challenge may be turned into an opportunity by developing some enthusiasm for spending more time on your own needs.\nMake the pivotal decisions in your own life and live directly with the consequences of your choices. Become your own best advocate in your forthcoming relationship. To help you accomplish this goal, shorten the list of circumstances and demands that have the power to distract you or divert your energy. Define your boundaries. State your goals clearly. Start acting on your own behalf. Championing your own needs may actually help you bring more clarity into a relationship by setting boundaries that your possible partner needs to respect.","interp_general":"Representing the energy of a Queen, this feminine power was traditionally known as a widow, crone or divorcee.

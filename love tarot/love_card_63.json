[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds.

You are the one with the final say.","interp":"The King of Swords in this position stands for fairness and even handed treatment. He settles disputes, assists in the resolution of conflicts and mediates.

Patient listening and penetrating questions are his signature, and those qualities are just what are presently being asked of you.","interp_general":"Traditionally, representing the energy of a King, this masculine energy form is the Adjudicator, the wise judge or mediator. He helps parties in conflict discover common ground and build upon it, and guides societies to see their greater good. His archetype is Solomon, ancient lawgiver and philosopher of the Old Testament. Sometimes appearing cool and detached, he can be misunderstood as not caring.\nBut emotional displays are just not his medium, nor is he moved by appeals to sympathy or pity. With the philosophical overview that comes from long experience, he listens deeply, watches closely and speaks last. In the end, his even-handedness and objectivity earn him the respect he receives from his community, and those who cannot work out their problems come to him voluntarily for advice.\nOccasionally this man is subtly detailed to imply that he is a woman in male armor. If you notice this theme in your deck, it is a reference to Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, archetype of a devout and inspired woman warrior, who was mystically led to abandon her social role to defend what she saw as the greater good. Although she was martyred young, her model crystallizes the message that sometimes the good of the whole is more important than the good of the individual, and in that case, even if you lose, you win just for being there.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":63},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about.

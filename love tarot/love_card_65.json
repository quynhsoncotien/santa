[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Wait patiently for circumstances to sort themselves out between you and the one you desire.","interp":"With the Two of Coins in this position, you may be in the midst of a relationship, or love-related, decision. A superficial examination reveals little difference between your alternatives, and trying to get hints from the environment isn't working, either. This situation is like trying to read a coin that is flipping in the air.\nBe patient. Let some time pass so that circumstances have a chance to sort themselves out. As the coin falls, the situation's mixture of influences will reveal itself, and you will have a better basis for the choice or decision you have to make.\nIt's easy in circumstances like these to feel an undue sense of urgency and to act before you think. But there is no need to respond too quickly at this time.","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, or a material or financial resource.\nThe Two in this suit generally features a youth juggling, with two coins juggled in figure-eight fashion, or just the coins without the youth -- one heads up, the other tails -- both flipping in the air. It is clear that until one or the other coin drops, the final call can not be made; there is more to learn before a decision can be made about appropriate action.\nThis card counsels patience, so do not allow yourself to be rushed. The figure-eight image is a symbol of immortality and eternity. Its message is \"No need to hurry. You have all the time you need to work this out, no matter how things appear right now.\" Implied within this scenario is the idea that changes are in the works, but you will do better to stay calm until you have more information. Everything is in flux at a time like this.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":65},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating.

Even if the one you desire gets swept in, stay open but remain noncommittal.","interp":"When the Two of Coins is in this position, it's as if everything rides on a coin toss, which seems to be an irrational way to make big decisions. Resist the impulse to let your future be reduced to black-and-white, mutually exclusive directions.\nAlthough some people, including your possible loved one may feel a need to be in control and jump to conclusions, there is no need for you to join them or take a position one way or the other. Are all the facts in yet? Or is the coin still flipping in the air? If you are patient, you will spare yourself grief, while truth reveals itself in its own good time. In the end, you may find yourselves incorporating elements from both sides!","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential.

[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior.

How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here?

Opposing forces seem to pull you apart. When this happens, the left brain is arguing with the right, and reason is in conflict with the heart.\nAlthough this is a difficult and painful position, timeless wisdom says to follow your heart. Resist trying to judge the situation in precise, rigid terms. Continue to gather clues, be receptive to new information, but choose with your heart. This time of confusion may turn out to be a fertile period for you. Do not squander your energy on premature action.","interp_general":"The Two in this suit usually represents conflicting ideas or visions. These must be reconciled by communication in order to arrive in a harmonious place or to complete strategic negotiations. Mixed signals prevail.\nWhile they may be appearing to try to communicate, opposite sides are missing each other entirely, with possibly drastic consequences.

Conflict arises to highlight needs that are not being met or communication efforts that are not being heard. Opposing partners may need a fair and objective viewpoint to help them see what is pulling them apart. If you are well positioned for such a task, you could possibly serve as a mediator or facilitator.\nAlthough certain risks are inherent in sponsoring a sensitive, diplomatic dialogue, you may have the right kind of non-blaming and non-threatening approach for easing this transition.

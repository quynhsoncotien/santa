[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Forego being interested in trivial things in your forthcoming relationship.","interp":"The Hermit in this position describes an individual who has a relationship with the spirit world instead of society. The Hermit prefers to specialize in what is esoteric. He studies the inner sciences -- yoga, tantra, self-cultivation. The Hermit is involved with consciousness development that takes him beyond the limited human ego and puts him in touch with the vastness of cosmic creation. He or she may have very little time for ordinary human commerce, relationship complexities, and its various distractions.\nThis card points to inner study. It's about immersing yourself in the mysteries of natural law. The Hermit looks like an old man but in reality he is an eternal child full of wonder, gazing into the mysteries of the inner life.","interp_general":"The challenge of what has traditionally been known as the Hermit card is to be able to recognize a teacher in a humble disguise. This font of mysterious knowledge will not make it easy for the student to acquire his wisdom, as it takes time and long contemplation to fathom what he knows. He often speaks wordlessly, or in ancient and barbaric tongues, communicating with the elements, animals and Nature herself.\nWhile the hourglass was an identifying feature on the earliest Hermit cards, more modern ones have shifted the metaphor, showing more or less light released from his lantern. In either case, the Hermit card reminds us of the value of time away from the hubbub of civic life, to relax the ego in communion with Nature.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":9},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about.

Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"What you are seeking is an uninterrupted period of contemplation and peace in your next relationship.","interp":"When the Hermit is in this position, you crave plenty of privacy and an end to the stimulation coming from friends, work, relationship, as well as every other civilized distraction. If at all possible, make the usual supervisors, critics, and back seat drivers disappear for a while. Then you can pull away from the people you have been involved with lately and forget about their agendas. This is a wonderful opportunity for contemplation. It's possible in a situation like this that you will experience some precognition and sense of what is to come.\nYour sense of inner stillness is precious. Let your potential love interest know what you need right now. Be understanding, but firm, in explaining that a demanding, needy relationship can hinder your progress at this time.","interp_general":"The challenge of what has traditionally been known as the Hermit card is to be able to recognize a teacher in a humble disguise.

This is your challenge. If you can pull yourself away from all superficial distractions and relationship concerns, you may receive some important guidance or insight. This card is suggesting that the hermit part of you is ready to be activated.\nSuch a deeply gratifying experience involves sacrifice. The usual comforts must be let go of for the  period of time while you are tapping into Spirit. Your relationship doesn't have to suffer, however, if you make known your need for some private time to recharge your batteries.","interp_general":"The challenge of what has traditionally been known as the Hermit card is to be able to recognize a teacher in a humble disguise.

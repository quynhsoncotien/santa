[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","position_name":"Love & Me","interp":"The Wheel of Fortune in this position indicates that your mind or your heart just won't keep still. It keeps churning up new developments or issues that you thought were resolved between you and your next potential partner. This is the nature of The Wheel of Fortune that never ceases to turn.\nYou probably feel like you want to get off life's Ferris wheel once in a while, but there is only one good way to do that -- take refuge in the hub, the center from which all the motion is emanating. Much as you might like to, there is no way to stay on top all the time. Your ultimate challenge is to learn to peak and drop without resisting the process, including all its ups and downs.","card":10,"interp_general":"The central theme of what is traditionally called the Wheel of Fortune card is cyclical change. The Wheel keeps on rolling, churning events in a ceaseless progression of ups and downs, either way freeing us from the past. No one can escape its cyclical action, which can feel somewhat terrifying -- no matter whether we are rising or falling. When one is balanced on top there is a moment of crystal clarity, but the only part of the Wheel not going up and down is the hub, which is your eternal Self, the Source of Freedom.\nEvery one of us will occupy all the points on the wheel at some time or another. The cycle of the wheel is its lesson -- and we can learn to take comfort in it (as we do when we celebrate our birthday). If you don't like the look of things right now, just wait -- things will change. Of course, if you do like the look of things right now, enjoy it while it lasts, because that will change too!","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Accept that the wheel continues to turn and that you have no choice but to adapt to its movement in your forthcoming relationship with your next partner."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"The Wheel of Fortune in this position indicates that your circumstances may be constantly fluctuating. The immediate future seems uncertain. Who can fault the you or your potential partner for feeling a bit overwhelmed? Of course, there is no sense in either one of you taking any of this personally. You may be in the presence of a force that is beyond your power to manipulate. It's a force no mortal can control. Naturally, you both want a more stable situation and firmer ground for this relationship to stand on.\nThis card is modeled on a rolling wheel, so what looks up will be down soon, and vice versa. Perceived correctly, this force is akin to the great washing machine of life. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, then the end result will leave you restored, like new.\nIt's a challenge to keep your composure in mid-cycle, however, because the part of you that prefers control can feel helpless. Wait and watch, and as you do, try to absorb and understand the process. Just remain patient and go with the flow.","card":10,"interp_general":"The central theme of what is traditionally called the Wheel of Fortune card is cyclical change.

Take heart and wait it out. Nothing is final yet, so why be pessimistic?"},{"position_header":"The Challenges position helps you get the best out of your relationship situation. it reflects the cutting edge, the learning curve whereby you can turn challenges into win\/win victories -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present  themselves. Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","position_name":"Challenges","interp":"The Wheel of Fortune in this position challenges you to ride it with composure. Learn to see change coming, for each relationship is subject to the continuity of life's seasonal pattern of ups and downs. Let yourself track the ebb and flow of its circumstances.\nRecognize, too, that there may always be an unpredictable element, a wild card. Don't fear this. Accept that the unknown is part of the dance. Learn the rhythms of Nature and do your best to synchronize with her. Be accepting of these coming relationship rhythms and who knows? You may even relax enough to enjoy the ride.","card":10,"interp_general":"The central theme of what is traditionally called the Wheel of Fortune card is cyclical change.

[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds.

Protect the interests of both you and the one you desire.","interp":"The Knight of Coins (in some decks, a Prince) in this position portrays you as someone who is responsible, patient, and of practical service. You realize that with right timing and proper attention, wise investments in a future relationship may multiply, like a field that has been cultivated.\nThis does not have to do with greed or even the profit motive as we think of it now. Your contribution is like that of the farmer who sows a field of grain for the sake of the entire community. Your service does not stop there, however. The crop of love and closeness that you treasure must be allowed to grow unmolested by predators or thieves. That's another reason we need to summon forth the stalwart knight who can be trusted to protect and defend the community and its harvest. This card implies generous usefulness of all types.","interp_general":"This card is usually called the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince. Traditionally, this card in this suit pictures an overseer of fertility and growth. His period of ascendancy is during the quiet years between conflicts, when everybody can collaborate in raising the collective standard of living. His horse is usually huge and thickset, more suitable to pulling a plow than riding swiftly into battle. His temperament is easygoing and relaxed, he's moving at the rate of the flow, because he knows that you can't hurry time.\nSeeing the bigger picture, like a farmer planning for the future, he doesn't allow momentary fads or fancies to distract him, and he doesn't take seriously those who do. One can feel his stability and dedication -- he is totally responsible and even somewhat predictable when it comes to his projects. He is earthy and gentle, as simple and deep as the soil he tills and the flowers he loves.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":75},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about.

Of the four Knights, the Knight of Coins is the one most likely to be found in the field, using his horse to drag the plow with dirt under his nails and sweat on his brow. You and your potential romantic partner may both have the same enduring qualities of humility and lack of pretense.\nNow is the time to grow together by displaying your willingness to do a good day's work. While others will want to follow your lead, your purpose is not to attract attention. Part of the instructional value of your combined contribution is to show that no one is so important that they cannot put their shoulder to the wheel when needed.","interp_general":"This card is usually called the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince.

So, start from the beginning and gain some experience to match your intellectual grasp of a future relationship. Temper whatever power you possess with patience and sensitivity to detail.

In this way you will not stray far from the truth, the substantial reality which supports your vision, and your greater goal.\nToo many people have a big dream and move immediately into action without first undertaking the necessary research, understanding, game plan or skills.

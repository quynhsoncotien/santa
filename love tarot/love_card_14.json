[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"The time is now for self-healing in your forthcoming relationship with your potential love interest.","interp":"With Temperance in this position, you are ready to take responsibility for getting well, no matter what it takes. The quest for health could be on a physical, emotional or mental level, or it may have to do with paying off \"karmic dues.\"\nIn any case, the work is to clear up past dysfunction and address entangled emotions in your potential relationship. The process will purge the toxic waste of unfinished business with your future partner that disables you. When you are ready, mix your powerful medicine. This is the right time to start healing yourself.","interp_general":"What is traditionally known as the Temperance card is a reference to the Soul. Classically female, she is mixing up a blend of subtle energies for the evolution of the personality. One key to interpreting this card can be found in its title, a play on the process of tempering metals in a forge.\nMetals must undergo extremes of temperature, folding and pounding, but the end product is infinitely superior to impure ore mined from the earth. In this image, the soul volunteers the ego for a cleansing and healing experience which may turn the personality inside-out, but which brings out the gold hidden within the heart. (This card is entitled \"Art\" in the Crowley deck.)","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":14},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"The situation or potential relationship's call for transformation or awakening is being answered.","interp":"The Angel of Healing in this position means both you and the person you desire will intrinsically understand that healing produces revolutionary change on both sides of the equation. Set each other free of the old roles and projections. You have needed things to be different and now they will be.\nDo not think for a moment that this possible relationship is not worth the effort. You and your potential partner may both emerge with much higher self-esteem and fewer regrets if you make the effort to see things through. Sometimes the remedy is found in going through the process rather than in arriving at any specific outcome.","interp_general":"What is traditionally known as the Temperance card is a reference to the Soul.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too.

Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"Changes need to be made steadily but gradually in a potential relationship.","interp":"Temperance in this position challenges you to gradually phase in changes in a forthcoming relationship, while letting go of old behaviors and thought forms. When we plant new varieties in a garden, we may also clean out some of the old. Over time, a new relationship dynamic may emerge. It's not all accomplished in a day. Healing is more of process than an event.\nBe patient and persevere. Blend the medicine with careful attention to detail. Focus your will and intention. Repeat the solution. Remember that too much is as bad as too little. Keep things in balance as you slowly and steadily change the composition of your energy from the old to the new.","interp_general":"What is traditionally known as the Temperance card is a reference to the Soul.

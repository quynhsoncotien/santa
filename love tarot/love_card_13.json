[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Let go of the past relationship pattern and move forward into a new phase.","interp":"The Death card symbolizes release and rebirth, the transformation that results from detachment. It may be time to cut cords with the ways and patterns of the past. Bring in the harvest, clear away the remains of the last cycle. The Death card is calling you to shed old identities in order to be able to express new ones, much like a snake shedding its skin. Go through this process of transformation willingly and voluntarily.\nBy cleaning up after the past and clearing away its residual relationship effects, you may make room for a higher manifestation to emerge. Think of this as a form of recycling in which you let go of attachments that would otherwise bind you to outworn thoughts and behaviors. You are turning a page in your romantic and relationship life. Cast off the detritus of the past and look forward to the future and potential relationships with optimism.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Death card is not about literal death of any person. It may represent the death of something else, like a project, plan or relationship. It also points to a time of harvest, symbolized in classical decks by the reaping skeleton. Unless the fruits of summer are harvested, they are lost to winter's harshness and the people do not eat.\nThis card portrays the action of winter on the landscape -- lush greenery is cut back, revealing the bones of the landscape. The season of dark and cold separates the annual plants, that live and die in one year, from the perennials, which can take refuge in their root systems until the following Spring, to sprout anew. As the scythe cuts the cords that link us to the past, it liberates us to go forward without fear, because we have nothing left to lose. We can see that everything pruned away is recycled for the fertility of the future, so that nothing is really ever lost, despite seasonal cycles of gain and loss.\nIn the more modern decks of the English school, we see Death mounted on a horse and wearing black armor. The emphasis in these decks is on the punishment of sin -- as in the way the medieval Plague, which the death image was based on, was used to explain the wrath of God. Luckily, in modern times, we are not so encumbered with such a guilt-ridden philosophy.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":13},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"Let go and make the adjustments required for dealing with a new set of circumstances. This moment will reveal what is essential to you and the partner you desire so you can let go of the rest.","interp":"The Death card in this position implies that a force of nature or a change in authority may be cutting off access to the old order and the established way of doing things. Both you and your potential romantic partner might be wise to respond to this definitive change. Try adapting your lifestyle to fit in with the turnabout.\nWhile neither of you may be in control of the outer flow of events, you can both develop a way of gracefully responding to them. It is time to make room for a future you might not have consciously chosen. As with the changing seasons, the transition is no one's fault. Yet it still needs to be faced with a courageous willingness to let go.\nLook forward with optimism because you will be on totally fresh ground once this period of adjustment is complete","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Death card is not about literal death of any person.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"Trust that dramatic relationship changes such as these only happen according to divine appointment.","interp":"The Death card in this position indicates the awesome challenge that death and rebirth present. Letting go is not easy, especially when we may be called upon to make a major shift in a potential relationship. Have faith that this change may benefit you more than clinging to the old ways would have. The farmer understands the truth of this card and the meaning of the sickle in the image. There is a time for everything: a time to plant, a time for things to grow and become fat, a time to harvest, a time for things to be cut back or lie fallow.\nYou may be dying to some part of your past. Accept the letting go of a possible relationship that needs to happen. Release your load. Is it possible that the attachments that have helped you feel secure have, in truth, come to own you? Accept this rebirth into better times. If fear of change or oblivion gets in your way, you may struggle to keep your morale up.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Death card is not about literal death of any person.

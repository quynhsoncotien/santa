[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","interp_header":"Clarify your motives in connection to a possible romantic partner before you get involved. Determine whether you are acting outside your role or not.","interp":"With the Page of Swords (in some decks, a Princess) in this position, you are playing the part of a canny investigator who is quietly gathering intelligence, listening behind the scenes, and perceiving unfolding trends and probabilities. Some call the Page the spy or the watchman. He can also be seen as a messenger. At his best, he faithfully transmits information that has been entrusted to him.\nThe temptation to color the message is great, however, making it important when this card appears in this position to know your motives. Why you are getting involved so deeply? What's driving your impulse to be part of the dialogue? Is there an urge to act beyond your mandate rather than function as a clear representative of truth? Be certain to assess and know this before you assume this role.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess. The traditional interpretation is about a messenger, an emissary or liaison between separate camps, charged with faithfully representing one side's communications to the other. Because of this role, we do not think of this person as a servant, but rather as a diplomat, facilitating sensitive negotiations, often under difficult conditions.\nThis person is acting as the eyes and ears of her patron, and so she is sometimes referred to as the Watchman. Even kings are powerless if this messenger chooses to use her access to sensitive information for her own gain, as is implied by her other name, The Spy.\nShe could even be working as a double agent, playing both sides against each other to serve her own agenda. Her title is really camouflage in itself, serving as protective coloration so she can move among the people unrecognized, collecting information anonymously. Her vigilance often conceals an ulterior motive. She is a watcher who must herself be watched, because she dreams of someday taking matters into her own hands, preempting the plans of her employers.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Love & Me","card":60},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","interp_header":"As a potential couple, you and a possible partner must regard each other as best friends and reliable confidants so that your personal affairs do not get spread all around.","interp":"When the Page of Swords (in some decks, a Princess) is in this position, you and a possible loved one may be contending with a somewhat suspicious and untrustworthy situation. You may be surrounded by gossips or blabbermouths -- or even worse, saboteurs. You certainly don't want to open up or share sensitive information to people who might abuse it. This card indicates a paranoid environment in which everyone is a self-centered spy and no one is quite sure whom to trust. Before you share too much, examine the motives of those who want to know.\nIn this situation, what people do not tell you is just as important as what they do. Keep your antennae turned on and you will be more aware of nonverbal clues. Work a little harder to understand where others are coming from so that their behavior doesn't confuse you. You and your possible love interest need to be best friends right now. With regard to the outer world, be like flies on a wall -- just watch and listen without drawing attention to yourselves.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess.

Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","interp_header":"You have the opportunity and position to influence the thinking of a possible romantic partner.

Recognize the patterns of thinking affecting those close to you. You may have an opportunity to influence a potential relationship on a daily basis.\nBy presenting new ideas and terms, you may change conditions and help refine shared goals. Raise awareness with quiet but steady input from the sidelines. Like the Page, avoid drawing attention to yourself. Position yourself in the world as a servant and aid to your possible love interest. Or, try to be a source for his or her better thinking. Perhaps at present your greatest strength may be your humility.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess.

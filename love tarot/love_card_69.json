[{"position_header":"The Love & Me position represents your personal identity within the relationship in the present moment, which is the only real point of power. It's not about who you are in any objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how another might be seeing you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the relationship issues you bring to this reading. What kinds of attitude or energies are affecting the way you relate? What do you want in a relationship?\nIt's not always easy to know oneself, but clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance because, more than anything, it can contribute to a healthy ability to your capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of you is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position after you have gone through all the cards in the spread.","position_name":"Love & Me","interp":"With the Six of Coins in this position, you are in a position to be generous if you want to be.  Generosity is always a win\/win. First of all, there is a feeling of warm power in giving, but it also improves your reputation while the other is being helped. But, be careful -- any act of munificence can carry within it the hooks of obligation or the seeds of ongoing dependency, creating a moral dilemma only the high-minded can manage well.\nYour motives are good, but no matter how much you want to help, it's also important to support  self-sufficiency in your friend. Finding the balance between kindness and accountability is the the responsible path that will help you avoid inadvertently creating unhealthy relationship dynamics.","card":69,"interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.\nThe Six of this suit is the card of patronage -- generosity with strings attached. The picture shows a rich man giving alms, his reputation enhanced from his giving, but without having helped anybody really better him or herself. Sometimes there is an inference that the giver will be expecting something back for his giving, perhaps sexual favors.\nSometimes this card is interpreted as referring to some kind of patron or benefactor who rescues a talented person from oblivion, but then wants to dictate what the artist works on as his fame grows. Inequality of power is generally a factor in this card, and the person being helped needs to be careful not to trade off heart and soul for a short cut to fame or fortune. Each player in this scenario needs to examine the possibility they are taking one side or the other in an unbalanced power struggle.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"This could be a good time to be open handed towards a loved one;  both you and the recipient of your generosity would benefit.\r\n"},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting relationship you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life and the way you are relating. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. The people we are involved with, as well as the ups and downs of the times naturally affect our experience. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make in your style of relating.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Six of Coins is in this position, there may be a significant gap between you and the person you are thinking of -- socially, financially or culturally. If there is such an imbalance, it is a predicament that can be frustrating because no amount of effort seems to make much difference. It seems that a level playing field is not in the cards.\nYour best bet may be to simply accept the areas of inequality and let that be OK between you. There is no harm in the more-endowed carrying the heavier load, if they don't mind. Problems arise if one confuses capability with personal worth. Don't confuse current access to resources with personal value. That is a spiritual matter that does not accommodate such comparisons.","card":69,"interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential.

Without greater efforts to create more balance, this future relationship could be one of dependency."},{"position_header":"The Challenges position helps you get the best out of your relationship situation. it reflects the cutting edge, the learning curve whereby you can turn challenges into win\/win victories -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present  themselves. Can you think of any patterns that are reappearing to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the relationship this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you  turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go relating. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to your partner.","position_name":"Challenges","interp":"The Six of Coins in this position bids you to find a way to be helpful without creating dependence. It may be a challenge to detach oneself enough from the outcome of one's own efforts to promote self-sufficiency in your possible partner. In some relationships people need assistance or support, and it is good to help them. But if you spend your energy doing for someone who can readily help his or her self, you may be performing a disservice.\nWhere is your best contribution? It may not result from saving or rescuing. Actually, it may hinge on encouraging and challenging your significant other to rise above current limits. See if there may be a way for you to create incentives for higher performance in your next relationship.","card":69,"interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential.

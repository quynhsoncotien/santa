[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Two of Cups in this position is shouting \"Love!\" This isn't necessarily about a traditional love affair. It could be a strong heart connection between yourself and someone you care greatly about. It could even be an attraction to an ideal or a vision that is as real to you as any interpersonal relationship. \nIt can also represent a reconciliation between your own masculine and feminine aspects. In any case, this card is referring to that aroused, emotionally sensitive space we enter when we are opening up at a deep level. This may be a sweet, adorable moment, but you can't deduce from this immediate feeling what the ultimate outcome of the relationship will be. Nevertheless, this card does encourage the idealism that creates fidelity and trust, empathy and compassion -- the very human virtues we need most in our lives and relationships. Your emotional, psychic and spiritual lives are quickening like spring. Enjoy this wonderful feeling and bless the world with it, but don't make any serious commitments at this time.","card":37,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls. This card traditionally describes a romantic relationship, but also includes the idea that all good friendships and partnerships are based on a natural affinity and a deep mutual understanding. As a personal reflection, it can also signify that your mind and your soul are discovering each other, maybe for the first time.\nThis card also symbolizes a karmic tie, often portrayed by a wreath or figure eight ribbon twining around the two cups. Occasionally you see a symbol referring to the union of alchemical opposites (as in sacred sex), pictured as a long-necked flask twined with serpents -- sometimes with wings -- spouting flames. This image is from Alchemy, indicating the refining and mutually completing effect of a true and lasting love.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Feelings of renewal and idealism are arising in you, which will empower you to radiate the higher virtues to all around you."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Two of Cups is in this position, you are dealing with a situation which may be permeated by a romantic, idealistic and psychically open quality. Such a state of affairs practically suspends the ordinary rules of reason. \nIt is as if you are operating within a different field of gravity where it works better to use your sensors than your logical mind. You may want to feel your way through this situation rather than relying on intellect. It's not that things are doomed to being irrationally erratic. It's just that something in the air transcends logic as psychic, emotional and spiritual energies permeate the atmosphere.","card":37,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"The Two of Cups in this position presents an opportunity for you to reveal yourself at a deep level of trust and truth, but do so only with those who have earned your trust and have proven their loyalty. This is definitely not a time to forsake your boundaries and merge with someone, even if this is what your instincts and desires are pushing you toward. \nYou may feel completely smitten and would like to be swept off, but don't give yourself away! No relationship that is realistic will expect or demand one hundred percent surrender.  No healthy person would accept such an expectation in the name of love. It's not required that you rescue anyone or be rescued, or that you risk everything for another. Give up dramatic agendas. It's most important that you meet half way, with hearts open, and get to know each other better.","card":37,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls.

[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Two of Wands in this position indicates a need to stop and get your bearings. Your path has seemed erratic and unclear, necessitating new choices every few steps. Make no moves that will produce permanent consequences until you have worked your way through this period of confusion, insecurity and lack of clarity. \nUncertainty will pass and you will see the bigger picture again. If you are patient and sincere, the right path will be revealed to you.","card":23,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.\nThe Two in this suit, often portrayed as crossed wands, imply a deadlock due to energies working at cross-purposes. This could refer to an internal split -- perhaps a duel between optimistic and pessimistic parts of your psyche, for example -- or some situation where you feel \"damned if you do, damned if you don't.\" This could be a standoff with another person or rubbing up against limitations that are currently imposed upon you.\nThis card points to the possibility of creeping self-doubt -- the kind that arises in a situation where one has bitten off more than one can chew. Give yourself a moment to take in the full implications of your situation. Find your bearings again before launching back into action. Deal with real concerns now -- before they become regrets!","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Assess your situation with patience and self-restraint."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"The Two of Wands in this position suggests a person or a group that may not be particularly clear about goals and stalls the process by getting caught up in the tiniest details. Although this can feel agonizing to an ambitious person, it may be wise to accept this kind of hesitation as a necessary step. \nThe collective has yet to identify its highest interests. Not until people become sufficiently uncomfortable with the situation will anything significant happen. Others need time in which to assess the situation and act accordingly so refrain from getting hasty about trying to fix things. You may be faced with greater problems later on if you permit the group to proceed without adequate preparation. Buyer's remorse could be a problem if decisions are rushed.","card":23,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"The Two of Wands in this position provides a challenge to learn to use down time productively. Creativity requires leisure. There is no available energy for forward progress at this time anyway, so rest and restore yourself. \nRather than waste time during such an opportunity, use it for contemplative relaxation or meditation. Don't worry about how to orchestrate things just yet; just open yourself to the sights, sounds and realities of the situation as it is. This will put you in a more favorable position when the time for action arrives.","card":23,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

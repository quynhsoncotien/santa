[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"A sacrifice mediates the situation and returns it to normal.","interp":"The Hanged Man represents the taking of a loss. He's the sacrificial lamb, whether it's accepted with grace or only because it's been forced upon him. In either case, his ordeal serves to clear the air of general tension, denial and game playing. The Hanged Man's predicament brings issues to a head, making it possible to clear the slate and allow everyone to start over.  \nWhether it's purely symbolic or has to do with real events, such a situation can clear the collective conscience and helps to break old patterns. It's a good thing that it's you playing this vulnerable role, and not someone else who may be broken by the situation. You are resilient and regenerative, someone who can view this experience as educational and not be totally victimized by it. This is the enlightened attitude. Your sacrifice will make a difference in the larger flow of events, even if it's not fair and you don't deserve it.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card known as the Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action. This energy is arrested and awaiting judgment. With this card, there is no avenue for the will to regain control until the situation has passed.\nThis represents a good time to be philosophical, to study and meditate upon the position you find yourself in, and form resolutions for the moment you become free again. Only those who possess wisdom, patience and optimism will be able to see through limitations, including possible humiliation, to grasp the inspiring lesson one can gain from such an experience.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":12},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"Someone's stance, style or point of view must be sacrificed to relieve the situation of stress and unsettled feelings.","interp":"The Hanged Man in this position indicates that a scapegoat may be needed. The situation will feel tense, difficult, and blocked until someone is produced to absorb the blame. Scapegoating doesn't require truth or justice. It is the result of the collective projection of guilt. Some situations may be wired to such a degree that heads must roll. Those who subject themselves to a position such as this know the odds and prepare to undergo their fate in the way of the warrior -- with composure and dignity. \nShow compassion for this person. If it is not you, remember but for the grace of God it could have been. There is no moral stain on those who find themselves in the position of the scapegoat. There is one, however, on those who judge themselves to be superior and immune to this fate. The ordeal will have been worth it if it brings the participants, including you, to a new point of view and release from the past.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card known as the Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","interp_header":"When forced into a situation where you can only observe events, how can you be held responsible?","interp":"The Hanged Man card in this position challenges you to use periods of censure or helplessness to study the situation thoroughly. These kind of predicaments release you from the obligations and responsibility of being in control, and serve as witness to what happens when vindictive types get their hands on the wheel. \nStarting within yourself, you can stay neutral and learn from the temporary periods of chaos that follow mob psychology. When one is caught short and strung up, he or she can't be blamed for what comes next.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the card known as the Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action.

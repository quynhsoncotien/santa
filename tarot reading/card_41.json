[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Six of Cups symbolizes nostalgia and its power, illustrating two sides of your nature.  When you look back at the past, your emotions soften; you feel tender, open and sentimental.  When you look to the future, you know your will must harden; you need to be more  powerful, directing the flow rather than following. \nIn the past, you were younger and lighter. Issues were also less complex and confusing. You were not empowered in the way you are now, however. The present is full of fresh potential while the past is two-dimensional, a snapshot of times gone by. It's fine to enjoy nostalgia and sentimentality, but when you have finished refreshing yourself in the waters of memory, come back to the present with energy for the future, where your scope is so much broader.","card":41,"interp_general":"The Six of this suit generally represents a refreshing openness and innocence, a willingness to learn and an optimism that things will get better as we advance together in understanding. The traditional title, The Past, reminds us of our original nature, when we were young and enthusiastic, when anything was possible and the future was an open book. We are to remember that this same freshness, those new possibilities, are always available to us, even now.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Although a fond look at the past is pleasing and refreshing, your fulfillment lies in the future."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about.

Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Six of Cups is in this position, the immediate circumstance may be powerfully reminiscent of the past. Your mind and heart recall long forgotten places, faces and feelings. Much information is stored within these memories and something about the present circumstance is triggering them. \nIt's worthwhile to compare what you feel now to what you felt long ago. We can never be sure what memory will bring back. Still, we can trust the memory to connect us to things and events through emotional resonance. Asking yourself what is familiar in this situation will help you understand and evaluate the significance of your immediate experience.","card":41,"interp_general":"The Six of this suit generally represents a refreshing openness and innocence, a willingness to learn and an optimism that things will get better as we advance together in understanding.

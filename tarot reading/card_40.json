[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"When the Five of Cups is in this position, you are assessing the mixed messages you received in the past about relationships, an emotional legacy of highs and lows which you could be inclined to repeat. Every family creates an emotional climate that ultimately shapes the character and style of each child. \nEarly confusion about whether you were loved or wanted colors how you react to and interpret people in your present life. The Five of Cups suggests that you may be agonizing over a pattern from the \"bad old days\" which is arising in your present life. Don't let yourself simply sink into feeling miserable. Get up and try to make it right again.","card":40,"interp_general":"The Five of this suit traditionally portrays the mess that is left after an emotional upheaval, such as a tantrum or fit of rage. Consequences run the gamut from a hangover and lost wages, to abuse and ruined relationships.\nThis card is also sometimes called Inheritance, suggesting the cross-generational legacy of such tragedies. Violent family patterns magnified to a much larger scale can become war.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Past patterns that once confused you can be overcome; take action to change them."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"The Five of Cups in this position points to family patterns and traits passing on through new generations. The sins of the fathers are visited upon the children. Fortunately, so are the blessings. Your current situation illustrates that the best and worst things that happen to you may be conditioned by the lineage you spring from. You cannot easily escape inherited themes and characteristics. They are coded into the synapses of your nervous system. Such is the poignancy associated with this card. \nIn the image on the card, three cups have spilled. Two cups are still full. No matter what may have been lost between generations, some qualities are carried forward. We can benefit from inherited learning, change our reactions and bring in new behaviors. Make an effort to retrieve what can be saved and built upon as a resource for the next generation.","card":40,"interp_general":"The Five of this suit traditionally portrays the mess that is left after an emotional upheaval, such as a tantrum or fit of rage.

Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"When the Five of Cups is in this position, maximize what is left after loss. The receiver of this card received copious potential in the five cups shown, but three of them have been upended and their contents spilled into the earth. Whether it was carelessness or destiny that spilled these cups isn't ultimately important. \nWhat matters now is that the two full cups be tended and utilized as intelligently as possible. Resources can be built up and the core value of what was passed on can be cultivated again. You have this opportunity to make the best of what is left to you after a tumultuous upset. If you sink into depression about what is lost, you are going to get nowhere. Focus on the value that still remains, and make the best of it as optimistically as possible.","card":40,"interp_general":"The Five of this suit traditionally portrays the mess that is left after an emotional upheaval, such as a tantrum or fit of rage.

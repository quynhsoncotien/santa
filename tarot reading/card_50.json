There is a wind sweeping across this card that has an agenda of its own, but you have a map (your plan) and a sail (your mind). Using them both, you can use that wind to empower you on your chosen course. Knowing you can depend upon your own quick wits and adaptability frees you to see opportunities that might be as invisible as the wind to others. Because you hold the map that will help others understand how to sail from chaos to order, determine how you can serve both yourself and this situation creatively. This level of organization is more critical at the planning stages of an enterprise than most people generally realize or remember. You could be a hero by stating clearly what you see at this important stage. Don't hold yourself back.","interp_general":"This suit represents the rational mind and its ability to discriminate.

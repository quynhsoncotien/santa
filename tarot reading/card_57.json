[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Eight of Swords in this position indicates that you may be investigated in some way. A rigorous scrutiny could feel like an inquisition to you. This could be some challenge to your sense of mastery in your situation or field. \nRefuse to take any of it personally. Sharpen your thinking, your sword of truth, in order to answer your examiners. As your ideas are being questioned and dissected, you may be asked to justify each and every detail. Consider this card as a reality check. Do your ideals stand up to scrutiny? If you can safely navigate this minefield you will emerge on the other side, stronger and proud of how you passed the test.","card":57,"interp_general":"Often called \"the Test,\" the Eight of this suit usually pictures a warrior running the gauntlet, subjected to harsh examination, who finds out just how tough he is (or isn't) in the process. Life provides us with plenty of experiences that put us in situations of close scrutiny -- whether it's an entrance exam, a decisive job interview or even the tough conversations that follow upon a breach of trust in a close relationship.\nSometimes the challenge or obstacle course has nothing to do with other people, as when an inventor has to face the question \"Does it really work?\" or when the aspirant has to decide how badly he desires to go through some sort of initiation. This card shows what happens to that great idea in real time, where the rubber meets the road. The Test represents your chance to vindicate the time and energy spent in getting ready for a big moment. In most cases, you will either pass or fail, with little in the way of available middle ground.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"This is your moment to be tested and tried.

Clarify whether you are willing to sacrifice your own well being just to keep the peace. \nIn instances where irrational demands are being made of you, you owe it to yourself to question how much you are willing to put up with. You'll need to decide whether you still find value in this situation or whether the turbulence is just too stressful to withstand any longer.","card":57,"interp_general":"Often called \"the Test,\" the Eight of this suit usually pictures a warrior running the gauntlet, subjected to harsh examination, who finds out just how tough he is (or isn't) in the process.

Adopt the attitude of an athlete in a demanding sport. All your attention must be focused in the moment, and you must stay flexible in case of surprises.

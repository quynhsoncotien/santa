[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Seven of Wands in this position indicates you are getting ready for a moment of triumph.

This is a person who is truly gifted, standing head and shoulders above the rest, a standard-setter and exemplar that exceeds previous conceptions of what is possible.\nIn historical Tarot, this person would most likely be portrayed as an admired and feared warrior who has vanquished his adversaries against all odds, but nowadays such an outstanding feat could just as easily apply to the world of the media, politics or business.\nBeware of creeping smugness that can be hinted at by this card.

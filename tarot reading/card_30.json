[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"When the Nine of Wands is in this position, putting things off and giving yourself some time to rest is important, although it may be psychologically difficult for you to do so. In situations where we think we are irreplaceable, we all too often neglect to give ourselves time to rest and recuperate. \nIt would be to your advantage to find a competent ally who can fill in for you until you regain your energy. Try to remember that exhaustion impairs the ability to make good decisions, giving negative forces an opportunity to gain an advantage. For the sake of yourself and the entire situation, take a break!","card":30,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.\nThe Nine of this suit usually indicates a need for rest; some time out to mend wounds and savor victories. Although it may be hard to do, this card would have you leave the field to fresher teammates for now. Release any attachment you may feel to being in a leadership role for now.\nIn the pictured Tarot decks, the protagonist is shown as too exhausted to be effective in defending his gains, yet resisting the suggestion to ask for help or step down. He or she hasn't had the chance to totally heal from past blows, and is still up there taking another beating. This is the fix that comes from making oneself irreplaceable. Fight off the maniacal thought that only you can save the day! Stop rebuffing loved ones who want to help you.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Exhaustion ruins the ability to make good judgments; find someone who can fill in for you until you are refreshed."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"The Nine of Wands in this position suggests that a situation may call for re-organization. The current structure of a group may actually be damaging the leadership it depends upon for survival. The person who has been keeping everybody motivated and on track would be best served by taking some time off to rest and regenerate. \nThe ideal solution is for each participant to become as self-directing as possible. This will actually be an evolutionary step in the group's consciousness. The leaders or role models are not as vulnerable to criticism from those they have been trying to inspire and direct. Now, instead of one person being the hero, everybody can share both the responsibilities and the rewards.","card":30,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"When the Nine of Wands is in this position, the challenge is to resist the idea that you must swoop in and save the day. A person who instinctively leaps to heroics can fixate on the glory it will bring to the self, actually diminishing their capacity to serve the greater good. This is not to say you shouldn't do your personal best. \nSometimes we just need to stand back and let someone else have the glory, so we become better at sharing in and supporting others' accomplishments. There are usually enough challenging tasks to go around; it's not necessary for you to take the lead role in all of them.","card":30,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

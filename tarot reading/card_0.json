[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Fool is associated with circumstances that are unique, unpredictable, inscrutable -- one who is suspended between realities. The Fool is often portrayed as an empty headed simpleton unaware of the forces that move him to and fro, following his impulses. But tradition tells us that this Fool has a secret that protects him: the magic of synchronicity. \nHe proceeds without calculation, spontaneously, without hesitation or resistance. If you trust in your own mystery and that of Divine Providence, you can step into a new realm of opportunities. For now, trust your instincts. If you have no expectations, you have nothing to lose.","card":0,"interp_general":"Pamela Coleman-Smith's artful rendition of an \"innocent Fool\" archetype (Rider-Waite deck) is often used to represent Tarot in general. Early classical versions of the Fool card, however, portray quite a different character -- a person driven by base needs and urges, who has fallen into a state of poverty and deprivation.\nIn some instances, he is made out to be a carnival entertainer or a huckster. In others, he is portrayed as decrepit and vulnerable -- as the cumulative result of his delusions and failures. Not until the 20th century do you see the popular Rider-Waite image of the Fool arise -- that of an innocent Soul before its Fall into Matter, as yet untainted by contact with society and all its ills.\nModern decks usually borrow from the Rider-Waite imagery. Most Fool cards copy the bucolic mountainside scene, the butterfly, the potential misplaced step that will send the Fool tumbling into the unknown. Don't forget, however, that the earlier versions of this card represented already-fallen humanity, over-identified with the material plane of existence, and beginning a pilgrimage towards self-knowledge, and eventually, wisdom. The Fool reminds us to recognize the path of personal development within ourselves -- and the stage upon that path where we find ourselves -- in order to energize our movement toward deeper self-realization.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"You inhabit that transitional world between the past and the future."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times. This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Fool is in this position, the situation is undefined and open-ended. This can create either a feeling of panic or one of relief. When there is no blueprint, you are freed up from rules and restrictions. \nStill, only a truly secure individual can stay calm under such uncertain circumstances. It will become apparent who is in tune with the flow and who is not. Watch closely and learn a whole new way of approaching life.","card":0,"interp_general":"Pamela Coleman-Smith's artful rendition of an \"innocent Fool\" archetype (Rider-Waite deck) is often used to represent Tarot in general.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"When the Fool is in this position, you are challenged to remain balanced and optimistic during a period of uncertainty. Because you are momentarily free of preordained roles or titles, purposely detach yourself from the desire for them. Appreciate a point of view in which all your options are open and you are not limited by predetermined courses of action. Just as everything that exists was once a seed in someone's imagination, your future is a seed in your own. What visions would you use to germinate your future? The Fool's bag of tricks contains many powerful dreams. Open the bag and look at what you might be carrying in the way of seed ideas.","card":0,"interp_general":"Pamela Coleman-Smith's artful rendition of an \"innocent Fool\" archetype (Rider-Waite deck) is often used to represent Tarot in general.

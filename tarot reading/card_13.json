[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"Let go of the past and move forward into a new phase of being.","interp":"The Death card symbolizes release and rebirth, the transformation that results from detachment. It is time to cut cords with the past. Bring in the harvest, clear away the remains of the last cycle. The Death card is calling you to shed old identities in order to be able to express new ones, much like a snake shedding its skin. Go through this process of transformation willingly and voluntarily. \nBy cleaning up after the past and clearing away its residual effects, you make room for a higher manifestation to emerge. Think of this as a form of recycling in which you let go of attachments that would otherwise bind you to outworn thoughts and behaviors. You are turning a page in your life. Cast off the detritus of the past and look forward to the future with optimism.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Death card is not about literal death of any person. It may represent the death of something else, like a project, plan or relationship. It also points to a time of harvest, symbolized in classical decks by the reaping skeleton. Unless the fruits of summer are harvested, they are lost to winter's harshness and the people do not eat.\nThis card portrays the action of winter on the landscape -- lush greenery is cut back, revealing the bones of the landscape. The season of dark and cold separates the annual plants, that live and die in one year, from the perennials, which can take refuge in their root systems until the following Spring, to sprout anew. As the scythe cuts the cords that link us to the past, it liberates us to go forward without fear, because we have nothing left to lose. We can see that everything pruned away is recycled for the fertility of the future, so that nothing is really ever lost, despite seasonal cycles of gain and loss.\nIn the more modern decks of the English school, we see Death mounted on a horse and wearing black armor. The emphasis in these decks is on the punishment of sin -- as in the way the medieval Plague, which the death image was based on, was used to explain the wrath of God. Luckily, in modern times, we are not so encumbered with such a guilt-ridden philosophy.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":13},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"Let go and make the adjustments required for dealing with a new set of circumstances.","interp":"The Death card in this position implies that a force of nature or a change in authority may be forcing you to change your accustomed way of doing things. While you may have no control over these changes, you can control your reactions to them. It is up to you to make room for the future rather than trying to forestall it with old thinking or habits. \nFace the road ahead with a courageous willingness to respond to transformational energies without any resistance to what you are facing. If you earnestly do this, then no force will be able to overcome you.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Death card is not about literal death of any person.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","interp_header":"Trust that dramatic changes only happen according to divine appointment.","interp":"The Death card in this position points to the awesome challenge that death and rebirth present. Letting go is not easy, especially when we are called upon to make a major shift. Have faith that this change will benefit you more than clinging to the old ways would have. The farmer understands the truth of this card and the meaning of the sickle in the image. \nThere is a time for everything: a time to plant, a time for things to grow and become fat, a time to harvest, a time for things to be cut back or lie fallow. You are dying to some part of your past. Accept the letting go that needs to happen. Release your load, the attachments that have helped you feel secure but which, in truth, have come to own you. Accept this rebirth into better times. If fear of change or oblivion gets in your way, you will struggle to keep your morale up.","interp_general":"What has traditionally been known as the Death card is not about literal death of any person.

[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Chariot is a symbol of victory through mental control. The feeling of this card reminds us of an athlete poised for the starting gun. When the signal comes, he or she hits the ground running. The Chariot is not about the security of castle and moat. No, the Chariot represents an adventurous nature, a desire to seize the reins, a love of the open road. \nThe sphinx-like steeds are anxious to lunge forward and be on their way. This card reminds you to use the powers of your mind to steer that wild excitement and focus the energy, because the urge to action is unstoppable. When you take up the reins of the charioteer, you assume the rapid rise of the culturally, psychologically and technologically advanced and mobile individual, a world class citizen.","card":7,"interp_general":"Traditionally, the card usually entitled the Chariot points to a triumphal feeling of freedom, as if the charioteer is being paraded through the streets as a hero (or heroine). The card reflects congratulations for high achievement, and serves as a sign of empowerment.\nHuge wheels and frisky steeds speed the rate at which the driver's willpower can be realized. This kind of charge makes more of the world accessible to anyone ambitious enough to seize the Chariot's reins. But there is danger in this feeling of freedom, because of the increased rate of change and its power to magnify mistakes in judgment.

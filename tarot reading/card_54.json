[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"A feeling of imbalance and negativity prevails.","interp":"With the Five of Swords in this position, you are internally conflicted, in a state of imbalance.  You could say one part of you is odd and one part of you is even. An unequal split characterizes any division of the number five. \nThe result of the imbalance is stress, friction and confusion. Your interior dialogue may be combative, defensive, shaming and blaming. You feel that whatever you do isn't quite good enough. Self-doubt may undermine your confidence. It seems that everything is against you. Negative thinking is an easy tendency at a time like this, as if you have internalized a critical parent who is continually harping at you.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the Five of this suit references the grim and sobering process of cleaning up the battlefield after a conflict. The war as a whole has not been won or lost yet, but in this skirmish there were grievous casualties. This card admonishes the loser to study carefully what went wrong, so that a new strategy can be devised and more setbacks forestalled. There is a need to regroup and rethink the game plan, discover your blind spots and weak links, and take corrective measures before getting back into the field for another round.\nIn these modern times, when the battle is more often being waged with words, laws and contracts instead of weapons, we have even more reason to examine our approach, our style, strengths and weaknesses. If we have underdeveloped communication skills or lose our objectivity in tense moments, our ability to reach our goals and dreams will decline. But, if we avoid letting ourselves be haunted by the misfortunes and detours that inevitably befall us, we will go on to achieve those goals. Do not obsess. Try to learn something.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":54},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"When self-interest undermines unity, help to teach the others how to cooperate in a common cause.","interp":"When the Five of Swords is in this position, polarizing forces in your immediate environment may be jeopardizing the possibility of teamwork. Such forces could pit individuals against each other in a way that stops the greater flow of progress and mutual support. Help those around you to see beyond their petty differences. \nThis may require challenging them to look for the real causes of their bickering. Is there a chance that too much subjective thinking is undermining the group effort? This is not a favorable trend. If there's anything you can do to keep it from getting worse, it is up to you to make the attempt now.","interp_general":"Traditionally, the Five of this suit references the grim and sobering process of cleaning up the battlefield after a conflict.

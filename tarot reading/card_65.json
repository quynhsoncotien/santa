[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"Wait patiently for circumstances to sort themselves out.","interp":"With the Two of Coins in this position, you are in the midst of a decision. A superficial examination reveals little difference between your alternatives, and trying to get hints from the environment isn't working, either. This situation is like trying to read a coin flipping in the air. \nBe patient. Let some time pass so that circumstances have a chance to sort themselves out. As the coin falls, the situation's mixture of influences will reveal itself, and you will have a better basis for the choice or decision you have to make. It's easy in circumstances like these to feel an undue sense of urgency and to act before you think.  But there is no need to respond too quickly at this time.","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, or a material or financial resource.\nThe Two in this suit generally features a youth juggling, with two coins juggled in figure-eight fashion, or just the coins without the youth -- one heads up, the other tails -- both flipping in the air. It is clear that until one or the other coin drops, the final call can not be made; there is more to learn before a decision can be made about appropriate action.\nThis card counsels patience, so do not allow yourself to be rushed. The figure-eight image is a symbol of immortality and eternity. Its message is \"No need to hurry. You have all the time you need to work this out, no matter how things appear right now.\" Implied within this scenario is the idea that changes are in the works, but you will do better to stay calm until you have more information. Everything is in flux at a time like this.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":65},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"Resist the impulse to join those around you who are becoming polarized in opposing camps.","interp":"When the Two of Coins is in this position, you may be surrounded by people who are busy taking sides. If so, resist the impulse to join either camp. Some people with a need to be in control may  jump to conclusions. You do not have to join them, however, or take a position one way or the other. \nAsk yourself -- are all the facts in yet? Or do unknowns still govern the day? If you are patient, you will spare yourself grief, while truth reveals itself in its own good time. Don't let fear have its way with you -- you may discover the situation was never as serious as it seemed.","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential.

[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"The inheritor of prestige and influence is also required to meet certain obligations.","interp":"With the Ten of Coins in this position, you are the proper inheritor of a family tradition or ethic that makes you an important person in your community. This underlying heritage may have so thoroughly permeated your history and development that you have gone to special lengths to be distinct from it, to avoid becoming swallowed by it. \nLiving up to this legacy can feel like a burden, but it is yours to bear both literally and karmically and it would be wrong to reject it. Obviously this situation provides you with stability and security, but it also creates special obligations. Maturity and sobriety are great allies to a person who has been given so much in terms of money, education, skills or responsibilities.","interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents the final result of cumulative efforts -- perhaps after generations of effort -- resulting in such abundance that it directly and indirectly supports a lot of people. One layer of meaning refers to the pride of supporting your own lineage of well-loved souls.\nImagine a flow of resources so abundant that you are filled not only with pride but also self-respect and gratitude. Such bounty can impact the destiny of many families and generations. Nobility obligates its possessors, and the obligation must be passed down from generation to generation along with the abundance and freedom.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":73},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"You must accommodate an entire spectrum of experience as you move among the privileged.","interp":"The Ten of Coins in this position speaks of people who have a high degree of privilege. Both the negative and positive sides of these highly accomplished and affluent individuals are revealed through the daily contacts you make. \nYou have something important to learn by witnessing their exclusive mode of living. To become a true world citizen, you need to be able to move among all classes of people. This involves learning to feel natural in situations of great opulence and interacting with people who take their life of luxury for granted.","interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents the final result of cumulative efforts -- perhaps after generations of effort -- resulting in such abundance that it directly and indirectly supports a lot of people.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","interp_header":"Take care not to let your creative spirit be seduced by too much privilege.","interp":"The Ten of Coins in this position challenges you to read between the lines of affluence, privilege and gracious living and keep the human drama clearly in focus. There are many people who, when elevated to a level of relative security and comfort, lose track of their original natures and mistake their circumstances for their true worth. They may be forgetting that with their abundance comes the obligation to build a healthier society. \nThe spirit to keep striving until something great is achieved can die away when a person becomes comfortable. If you want to stay vital, creative and progressive then you must not become seduced by the good life. Don't let your lack of survival stress soften your drive to improve the world for the \"little guy.\"","interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents the final result of cumulative efforts -- perhaps after generations of effort -- resulting in such abundance that it directly and indirectly supports a lot of people.

[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"With the Two of Swords in this position, indecision prevails, and there are no obvious clues to help you decide which choices to make. Opposing forces seem to pull you apart; the left brain is arguing with the right, reason is in conflict with the heart. \nAlthough this is a difficult and painful position, timeless wisdom says to follow your heart. Resist trying to judge the situation in precise, rigid terms. Continue to gather clues, be receptive to new information, but choose with your heart. This time of confusion may turn out to be a fertile period for you. Do not squander your energy on premature action.","card":51,"interp_general":"The Two in this suit usually represents conflicting ideas or visions. These must be reconciled by communication in order to arrive in a harmonious place or to complete strategic negotiations. Mixed signals prevail.\nWhile they may be appearing to try to communicate, opposite sides are missing each other entirely, with possibly drastic consequences. In the best case, a frank discussion would clear the air and serve both sides, but one cannot expect that in every instance where this card shows up.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"When you are conflicted, spend some time gathering information before taking action."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about.

Conflict arises to highlight needs that are not being met or communication efforts that are not being heard.

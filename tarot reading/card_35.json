[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"You appreciate the benefits that come from confidence and authority.","interp":"The King of Wands in this position shows you projecting an authority and security that can rightfully inspire pride and appreciation. This is your time to shine and for your accomplishments to be recognized. He is sometimes interpreted as autocratic, however, so strive to be objective and open-minded to avoid overly offending others who may feel jealous.  \nRemember that everything is cyclical and passes through its own seasons: a sense of serenity felt at the top is no guarantee that the high-ranking position will last. Stay balanced and use power wisely to set a good example for those who will follow in your footsteps.","interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.\nTraditionally representing the energy of a dynamic King, this card represents the classic conquering hero. He's a charismatic leader, entrepreneurial and ambitious, always creating new adventures. He does this because he doesn't like to stay home or to have to \"mind the store\" -- he gets to feeling restless and bored with the predictable. If you need a crusader, or someone to take on a big challenge, he's your man. He needs a big assignment, and would rather lead than follow.\nIt could be said that he has a bit of an ego, as evidenced in his enjoyment of flattery and praise. Ever a bit the performer, he overachieves in situations where it will be noticed, but in private he wants to be served and adored like the head lion of a pride. A benevolent despot, he makes life wonderful for those he loves, and just the opposite for those who displease him.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":35},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"The designated leader needs your support right now, even if he or she does not yet know how to use power objectively.","interp":"The King of Wands in this position suggests that a new level of authority has been assumed by someone in the environment and that person may still be getting used to this position. Your patience and compassion can help them get their bearings. It is not in your best interests to appear competitive, so lend your support humbly. \nResist the temptation to upstage this person even if it would be easy. Your friend, newly emerged as a leader, needs your support right now, even if he or she does not yet use power objectively.","interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","interp_header":"Learn to practice leadership by sponsoring progress and innovation rather than by fighting for control.","interp":"The King of Wands in this position exposes the fine line between bold leadership and irritating, autocratic bossiness. At times those who would benefit from some helpful management resist it the most, even though their situation could be vastly improved if they were receptive to some direction. \nIf you see the need for a new way of doing things, then you will have to inspire others in that direction without setting off their anti-authority alarms. It's less important, however, to care about image than to get the job done. Stay centered on the challenge and others will not be tempted to find fault.","interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

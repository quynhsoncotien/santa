[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"Although you have been seeking some satisfaction in the external world, the process has been leading you to reconciliation with your inner self.","interp":"When the Ten of Wands is in this position, it's clear that the path of action you have taken is ultimately not as important as the state of being it can produce. You are beginning to realize that what you have been pursuing is actually internal, something which when kindled and awakened replaces your need to seek satisfaction in the external world. \nThis is not to invalidate all that you have been engaged in, because it has ultimately led you to this valuable realization. But when you assimilate what you are learning about Being, action will no longer seem as imperative. Take this opportunity to learn to meditate and find within what you previously looked for outside yourself.","interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.\nThe Ten of this suit represents an all-out effort, an obsessive commitment to a task which demands everything you've got. The person shown in decks with pictures is in no position to rest until he makes it inside the stout walls of the well-defended castle in the distance. If he fails, he will become prey for the highway robbers after dark.\nIt doesn't matter that he's overloaded and underfed. With this card, you have to do whatever it takes to get to completion -- nothing can be allowed to interfere.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":31},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"Transformation is difficult now. Look within for solutions.","interp":"The Ten of Wands in this position suggests that this is a time of stability and security -- a much needed break from stressful striving. However, the situation may be somewhat resistant to transformation and progress. Your recent surge of creativity is winding down. Resources that once seemed endless may no longer support continuous expansion. \nThe next stage or project, yet to be discovered, could be found within rather than in the external environment. Relax in this moment of stability. Don't distract yourself from an opportunity for greater clarity by trying to stay busy.","interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","interp_header":"Review your recent experiences in the light of who you are becoming; the process will give you fresh energy.","interp":"The Ten of Wands in this position requires you to re-evaluate your motivation for continuing to do what you have been doing, because your previous motivations have been exhausted. You took things as far as you could; now you are gaining wisdom from the experience. \nTry to determine the pattern behind the circumstances that brought you to this point.

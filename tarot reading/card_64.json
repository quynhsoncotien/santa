[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"You are becoming increasingly aware of your contribution and value.","interp":"The Ace of Coins in this position indicates you are in a position to discover that your life force, your consciousness and your growing value to the world are all the same thing. This card represents an increasing awareness of your contribution, and the path of your fulfillment in this life. \nEverything we achieve is a reflection of our character and personality. This first coin can form the foundation of your expanding worth, attracting more, until you accumulate all the abundance you could ever dream of. But first you must become magnetic.","interp_general":"This suit, most often named \"Coins\" or \"Pentacles\", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.\nThe Ace of this suit is usually pictured with a garden or agricultural backdrop, and symbolizes a seed. If this \"talent\" is planted and tended carefully, it will sprout and reward you with a good harvest. Think of it as a seed of your future fulfillment. An ace represents the first step to a goal, and if that step is repeated, it will cover great distances. Generally, the suit of Coins are referring to the tangible realities in daily life, but in the case of the Ace, it could be symbolizing a winning idea, game plan or blueprint for eventual materialization.\nOccult tradition sometimes interpreted this Ace as representing the alchemist's gold -- the light within Matter, the 3rd Eye of the energy-body. This recommends meditating upon the Light Within, and pointing oneself toward the archetype of Humanity Enlightened. By practicing such a meditation, the Masters taught that one eventually gains enough control of the Celestial Radiance to heal the body, untangle the emotions and complete the growth of the soul.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":64},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about.

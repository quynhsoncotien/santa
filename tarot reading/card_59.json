[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Ten of Swords in this position signifies a sense of grim relief. At this point you are no longer obligated to exert any more effort because there is nothing more you can do. Under the circumstances, no one can rationally expect you to have any power to change the situation. \nIn a sense, you are free. You may be in shock, flattened, but that is understandable and acceptable. It is best not to try to do anything about your condition at this time. This card gives you permission to surrender to the inevitable. Be assured that in time you will recover, you will again have some wind behind your sails. But for the present, you're just knocked out. Admit it and go with it -- what else can you do?","card":59,"interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents finality, the end of something. As is easy to grasp from the picture in many decks, there is no hope for revival here. A limit has been reached, a line has been crossed and there is no turning back. In some situations this may be felt as a tragic loss, but it often brings with it a paradoxical sense of release and closure. The waiting and wondering are over. There is no more ambiguity. You can rightly let go and move on, as there is no more progress to be made here.\nEmotionally and psychologically, this card appears when one is exhausted and used up, burnt out by the effort of caring and responding and trying to make a difference. When a person feels this way, they have reached burnout and can no longer be held responsible for anything, and therefore can be forgiven for caving in or ceding the fight. The simple instructions are: \"Go no further along these lines!\"","position_int":1,"interp_header":"You are up against the wall, and it is appropriate to admit it."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Ten of Swords is in this position, the anticipated goal appears to have been aborted. Normalcy may have been disrupted and replaced with a certain amount of chaos. Despite appearances, all is not lost for you or your loved ones. It is, however, a shakeup of the prevailing order. You may be in no position to repair the situation because forces larger than you could be dominant right now. \nIf it seems like you have no control over the outcome, why spend energy trying? Perhaps all you can do is wait things out. Rely on the good sense nature gave you and save any remaining energy for a new start later on. Cut your losses and detach yourself from circumstances. If you do so, you might not have to go down with the ship.","card":59,"interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents finality, the end of something.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"The Ten of Swords in this position says \"Know when to cut your losses.\" Tap the good sense Nature gave you and let go of the situation, accepting that it cannot bear a lot of positive fruit right now. Certain lines of development are not worth following right now, no matter what promises or expectations may have been made.  \nThere may be no advantage in traveling this road any longer. Outrageous developments have effectively negated agreements or expectations. It's like the system has crashed and the progress you thought you had made is lost. The lesson in a case like this is to know when and how to detach yourself from a situation. Don't go down with the ship ... he or she who fights and runs away will live to fight another day!","card":59,"interp_general":"The Ten of this suit represents finality, the end of something.

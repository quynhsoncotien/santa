[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Four of Coins in this position suggests that you have been blessed with some kind of inheritance assets, which you are still learning how to put to good use. \nThis endowment may be monetary or it may be some other form of generous support. It gives you a relatively stable base upon which you can build. When you are fully aware of what a blessing it is, you can cultivate a feeling of gratitude and make the best use of your advantage. On the other hand, there is a chance you will squander its value. It's OK to be playful, but beware of irresponsible pleasure-seeking. \nIn the English-school decks, we see the image of a person who is stuck in his or her misunderstanding of how the material plane works. He's afraid to let go of his four measly coins, because he doesn't know he has to give in order to get. When looked at this way, this is the card of \"poverty consciousness.\"","card":67,"interp_general":"This suit, most often named Coins or Pentacles, is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential.

In some cases, the problem is ego-identification with the bounty, which can lead to showing off, trying to buy friends or stinginess. \nAt the center of the problem is the owner's lack of a solid sense of self, the wisdom to know how to use this opportunity.

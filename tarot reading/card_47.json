[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"The final steps of a long journey are about to be completed.","interp":"With the Knight of Cups (in some decks, a Prince) in this position, you are pictured as a road-weary traveler finally making it home. Arrival is the principal concept here. You have wandered far and wide, during which time you have had to rescue yourself from some challenging situations. \nFacing your illusions during this odyssey has caused you to appreciate what you once thought of as trivial or mundane. Now you are ready to return to the place you set out from with a changed attitude. It promises to be a joyful reunion.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince. Traditionally, this card in this suit has pictured a homecoming -- portraying a return to his true heart's home after a long journey. Like the prodigal son, he may be returning after long estrangement from all he holds dear.\nHis taste for adventure is exhausted -- there is no more romanticizing of battles or travel in strange lands. Now he wants to go where he will be recognized, wanted and welcome -- where he doesn't have to fight at every turn. He has the attitude of one who has become older and wiser, the prodigal son.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":47},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about.

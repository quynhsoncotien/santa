[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"This card, traditionally entitled a Page (in some modern decks portrayed as a Princess), in this position, suggests that you play the part of a messenger who represents forward-moving change. Others around you may seem unnerved by your influence because you may be disturbing their set, stable patterns. \nDon't take their discomfort personally. Those who are familiar with you know you to be a catalyst who is involved to instigate change; this is the important role you are called upon by circumstances to play.","card":32,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.\nThis card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess. This archetype is that of a unique individual, a nonconformist, often something of a bohemian, definitely independent by nature. He or she requires little in the way of affirmation or approval. Perhaps a malcontent, often an innovator or inventor, the energy represented by this card will only serve others until she or he figures out how to get others to serve her\/him.\nHis freedom is so important to him that he would rather go as a peasant among strangers than inherit a fortune with strings attached. Don't be fooled by his humble appearance. He is a future captain of industry or world leader, now serving his apprenticeship. He's sometimes seen planting his staff like a flagpole into the earth, out in the wilderness where he can start fresh, without having to make any compromises.

This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life.

When this card lands in this position, change is in the air. News may have been released about rapidly developing events that could put stress on your comfortable, established group dynamic.

Whatever it is, be prepared to participate in the wave of the future. \nChange will escalate quickly. Remember that this isn't necessarily a negative development. The essential thing to know now is that you are to respond, rather than retreat and wait.","card":32,"interp_general":"This suit, most often called \"Wands\" and sometimes called \"Rods\" or \"Staves,\" represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire.

[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Knight of Swords (in some decks, a Prince) in this position symbolizes a warrior readying for battle, about to defend a matter of principle. You are either feeling challenged or feeling a need to make a challenge. In effect, you are strapping on your armor and sharpening your blade. \nWhoever tangles with you now faces a daunting opponent, because a righteous indignation can motivate this archetype. Hopefully your cause is worth going through what lies ahead. Sometimes this character becomes so eager for the fight that he forgets what it will cost and how many other lives may be affected. Before you commit yourself to further action and reaction, be sure you are ready for all the consequences you could stimulate by initiating this campaign.","card":61,"interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince. Traditionally, this card portrays the restless mind, aroused by thoughts of offense and defense, storming around searching for a target to pounce on. He often feels slighted, has a chip on his shoulder and bristles with a hostile attitude. His usual method is to look for someone to blame for his irritation.\nFurthermore, in an attitude of righteousness, he may assign himself the job of correcting the offender. Jumping easily to conclusions, he shoots first, asks questions later and is therefore often guilty of overkill. This is not to say that he does not have his heroic side; a single-minded combativeness can have its value. However, even when he is doing the right thing, he is likely to be doing it for the wrong reasons. Apt advice for this card is to deeply question your motives for what you are thinking about doing. Forethought will assist you in discriminating between righteous and unrighteous causes. Control any traces of impulsive judgement!\nOccasionally you will notice in the detail on the card, that the person can be a woman rather than the expected man. There is some evidence that the tradition of knighthood included a certain number of \"anonymous knights\" who took mythic names and veiled their true identities. Living on the road with few or no servants, they served as free-lance defenders of travelers, champions of the little people against the exploitation of both highway robbers and the wealthy classes. Odds are that some of these knights-errant were camouflaged women, and that idea is preserved with the traditional representation of the Sword Knight.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"When you answer a challenge, prepare for the consequences."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about.

You may not know what has provoked such a situation. It may not even be personal, but perhaps you innocently wandered into a charged situation and unintentionally set it off. Use your instincts to determine a reasonable resolution. \nIf it's too late for that, prepare yourself for the inevitable offensive. Viewed optimistically, the situation could present you with a worthy adversary who teaches you how to defend your position without being intimidated. Try to see this as a chance to practice your moves and become stronger at holding your ground. In any case, there may be no need to make yourself responsible for the hostilities -- the situation was tense before you arrived on the scene.","card":61,"interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince.

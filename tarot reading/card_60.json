[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","interp_header":"Clarify your motives before you get involved. Determine whether you are acting outside your role or not.","interp":"With the Page of Swords (in some decks, a Princess) in this position, you are playing the part of someone who is quietly gathering intelligence, listening behind the scenes, trying to perceive unfolding trends and probabilities. Some think of the Page card as a spy or night watchman. He can also be seen as a messenger. \nAt his best, he faithfully transmits information that has been entrusted to him. The temptation to editorialize and color the message is great, however, making it important to know your motives. Why are you getting involved so deeply? What's driving your impulse to be part of the action? Is there an urge to go beyond your mandate rather than function as a clear representative of truth? Be certain before you engage the energy of this card.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess. The traditional interpretation is about a messenger, an emissary or liaison between separate camps, charged with faithfully representing one side's communications to the other. Because of this role, we do not think of this person as a servant, but rather as a diplomat, facilitating sensitive negotiations, often under difficult conditions.\nThis person is acting as the eyes and ears of her patron, and so she is sometimes referred to as the Watchman. Even kings are powerless if this messenger chooses to use her access to sensitive information for her own gain, as is implied by her other name, The Spy.\nShe could even be working as a double agent, playing both sides against each other to serve her own agenda. Her title is really camouflage in itself, serving as protective coloration so she can move among the people unrecognized, collecting information anonymously. Her vigilance often conceals an ulterior motive. She is a watcher who must herself be watched, because she dreams of someday taking matters into her own hands, preempting the plans of her employers.","position_int":1,"position_name":"Self","card":60},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","interp_header":"Learn to rely on your own judgment and keep your own counsel.","interp":"When the Page of Swords (in some decks, a Princess) is in this position, you are contending with a person or situation that to some extent is suspicious and untrustworthy. It indicates an environment in which everyone is looking out for himself and no one is quite sure whom to trust. \nYou are coping with a climate of pessimism; consequently people are armed and guarded against blame. In this kind of case, what people don't tell you is just as important as what they do. Be aware of nonverbal clues others may be giving out unconsciously. Work a little harder to understand others' motives so their behavior doesn't confuse you. Use your own judgment.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too.

Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","interp_header":"You have the opportunity and position to influence the thinking of those around you.","interp":"When the Page of Swords (in some decks, a Princess) is in this position, sharpen your mind and raise your intellectual and intuitive antennae. Recognize the patterns of thinking affecting those around you. You have an opportunity to influence the assumptions of those who interact with you on a daily basis. \nBy using new vocabulary and presenting new ideas, you can change conditions and help refine or upgrade shared goals. Raise awareness with quiet but steady input from the sidelines. The Page does not draw attention to himself. He positions himself in the world as a servant of powerful people; he or she is often the source for their better thinking. Perhaps at present your greatest strength is your humility.","interp_general":"This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess.

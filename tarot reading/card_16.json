[{"position_header":"The Self position represents your personal identity in the Now -- the only real point of power. It's not about you in an objective sense, but rather a reflection of how you perceive yourself. It points to an aspect of your self-image, outside of how others might see you.\nConsider the meaning of the card that lands here in light of your inner experience, your personal perspective about yourself and the issues you bring to this reading. Who are you? What kind of attitude or energies are affecting you right now? What do you want? It's not always easy to know yourself. Clarity about values and roles is essential for skillful behavior. Values evolve, but don't be too attached to roles -- they can change.\nYour attitude is of primary importance here because, more than anything, it supports a capacity for happiness, success and love. How are you contending with fears that arise? What aspect of yourself is in need of development here? Is there any attitude that may be in need of change?\nThe way you perceive yourself may prove to be accurate or inadequate as the reading unfolds. You may want to take a second look at this position at the end of the spread.","position_name":"Self","interp":"The Tower represents a rapid, creative charge that is unplanned and uncontrollable but presents a brilliant opportunity for transformation. Because of circumstances beyond your control, you have no choice. \nTry not to judge whether this development is good or bad. You won't know for awhile whether this was the worst disaster that ever happened or a significant breakthrough. It could be a combination of both.","card":16,"interp_general":"In practically all renditions of the Tower card, disaster is striking or has just struck. The demons of madness and despair are released from ancient hiding places, and nature conspires with human failings to destabilize a society. The upheaval is collective and impersonal. Let us remember these images were created for the educated nobles and clergy -- reminding them that they have the most to lose if the hierarchy is toppled.\nLightning is a fitting karmic payback for the guilt of those whose fortunes come from the exploitation or abuse of others. A modern subtitle might be \"Revolution,\" indicating that through drastic social change oppressed people can find renewed hope of better times. The Tower experience comes like a flash of lightning to topple the hierarchy of the old order, after which everyone can have a fresh start on a more equal footing.","position_int":1,"interp_header":"Significant change is brought about rapidly and unexpectedly."},{"position_header":"The Situation position provides a general context for your question -- the set and setting, the politics, whatever is going on around you that might be impacting the situation or issue you are consulting the Tarot about. This card could apply to a specific drama or dilemma that you are now confronted with.\nConsider this card in light of the issues, people, and forces shaping your environment, your current circumstances.  This position also refers to that which is true from the start -- i.e. the hand you were dealt.\nConsider the set of influences that surround you and affect your personal life. Take a look at how you have been wandering down your chosen path. Our experience is naturally affected by external factors and cycles, the ups and downs of the times.  This card can offer clues as to skillful adjustments you might make.","position_name":"Situation","interp":"When the Tower is in this position, significant energy must be released. Until that happens, no one is safe or secure. It could either be an accident of history or a natural development that had been building over time. \nThe charge is now at critical mass; just a little shift in the energy of the situation will cause it to be set loose. Although this may happen around you rather than to you, be aware that the situation is volatile and unstable. Prepare for chaos but don't take it personally.","card":16,"interp_general":"In practically all renditions of the Tower card, disaster is striking or has just struck.

It reflects the cutting edge in the situation, the learning curve whereby you can turn adversity into accomplishment -- using creativity and a positive attitude.\nThis card can point to recurring themes in the challenges you have faced in your life -- and to opportunities that may yet present themselves. Can you think of any patterns which are returning to affect you now? If so, try to recall how you have reacted in the past. Perhaps you can see new potentials, while noticing the hidden pitfalls too. Can you imagine a different way of responding to the situation this time around?\nThe wisdom of this card can help you turn surprises into strengths, blind spots into windows of opportunity. Bring creativity and flexibility to the way you go about your way in the world. Your expanding capacity will become an asset and source of inspiration to all.","position_name":"Challenges\/\u200bOpportunities","interp":"The Tower challenges you to make yourself strong enough to channel a high voltage blast. When the lightning strikes, most people feel fearful of their ability to assimilate the impact of sudden, forceful change. A few others go into overdrive -- they feel enlivened, creative, more intelligent and intuitive than usual. \nIt all depends on your ability to sustain shock and carry the charge. Prepare yourself to ensure that you are well grounded, as well as psychologically open and flexible. In this way, you can leverage some of the positive force of this energy when it's released and experience the least amount of negative kickback.","card":16,"interp_general":"In practically all renditions of the Tower card, disaster is striking or has just struck.

    "MAN":{
        "LINK":"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/man/gemini/",
        "SEXUALITY": "This is a man who gives little meaning to the act of sex. He has a youthful glow around him and will usually be potent for many years, but he doesn’t care about sex as much as he cares about the excitement that goes with it. He wants someone to challenge him but not dig into his insecurities. He needs someone smart enough who says the right things at the right time. He likes sex outdoors and can be quite a pervert, with no ill intention hidden. If he is in a long term relationship, he will expect change in their sexual activities all the time, almost as if he is frightened of the routine and what it represents. Gemini needs to be on the move, always changing partners, positions or locations.",
        "IN_RELATIONSHIPS": "You couldn’t exactly say that a Gemini man is dependable or reliable. He has no intention of letting their partner down, but he is not aware of the speed of changes in his feel of reality. When he is in love for real, he will have seasons in his feelings no matter the love. From spring and blossoming desire, to winter and unbearable distance, he is a difficult man to be with if you expect consistency. The only way he can remain in a functional relationship is if he finds a partner who is self-sufficient and fully independent. If he finds a partner who catches a glimpse of his winter and leaves him to boil waiting – someone to love him in the exact same way as he loves, but with a little more patience.",
        "LOVE": "When a Gemini man falls in love, it is hard to say how long it will last. He needs change and responds to the excitement and the surprising nature of their loved one. While he feels emotion, he thinks that it goes deep and will rarely ask himself if it is just something that will pass tomorrow. Enjoying the moment, he could truly get on their partner’s nerves if they constantly try to make plans for their future together. This doesn’t mean Gemini partner doesn’t care, but he needs spontaneity in his life because everything else makes him feel tied down. He is gentle, exciting, changeable, detached and can certainly make a woman laugh. He is all those things in one person and all in one day, every day",
        "CAN_YOU_TRUST": "This is a difficult question to answer, and the answer would most frequently be a simple “no”. You cannot trust your Gemini partner. This is not because he is a pathological liar, but because there is no way to predict what tomorrow will bring to his mind or his heart. There are many things he can say in the heat of the moment, and these are all complex mathematical equations that you have to decipher if you want to know if he meant to say what he said and understand what he actually wanted to say. However, if he shares his life with a partner with real emotional depth, able to feel his inner personality that doesn’t change overnight, he is a lucky man who will never betray his partners trust.",
        "DATING": "There is no way of knowing where he will want to take you out. He is not one of those traditional men who has the need to make the first step, and will gladly accept someone’s invitation to any place that sounds interesting. If he develops feelings, he will surprise his partner with different places, presents and all sorts of creative spices to their dating life. It is impossible to get bored with Gemini, unless they talk too much and this is also something that can be changed with one conversation. The best way to describe the dating life of Gemini is – anywhere and anyhow, for as long as it is spontaneous and carefree.",
        "UNDERSTANDING": "Usually Gemini is something like a superficial guinea pig to other people. The truth is his nature is not at all light and superficial, but very complex and hard to reach. If you are superficial yourself, you will never get beyond Gemini’s surface that everyone is allowed to see. This is a man distant from his own emotions and needs to get to the burning core of his heart, but doesn’t know how to do that. If he’s been hurt by his family, there is a great chance he will never go deep enough to understand himself and then it is even more difficult for others to actually see him. If someone recognizes the core of a Gemini man they will find that there is a root to all that childish charm and an incredible inner beauty.",
        "LIKES_AND_DISLIKES": "He is positive, adventurous and surprising, always on the move and ready to meet any life challenge. When he is truly in love, he shows his childlike heart, pure and untouched. However, there is a lot not to like when he gets distant and simply doesn’t care anymore. He can be unreliable, acting like a spoiled child and scared of his emotions.",
        "HOW_TO_CHOOSE_A_GIFT": "Take him somewhere he hasn’t been, buy him a book with practical instructions, give him anything that has letters on it or can be used to write, chat or take pictures. He likes different electric gadgets, strange, small things that can be used for his phone or by his finger. He wants freedom to use his present once and then throw it away. Whatever you decide to give to a Gemini man, top it all with a smile. That might be the only thing you both need."

    "WOMEN": {
        "LINK":"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/woman/gemini/",
        "LOVE":"When this woman falls in love, she develops a sudden flare for sweet talk and cuddling. As fast as she fell in love, she can find herself out of it and there is no guarantee that her loyalty or her emotions will last. Although Gemini is not such an emotional sign, she is a woman first, and she will have deep emotions although she might approach them superficially. Almost as if she doesn’t really understand how she feels. It’s a rule that a Gemini woman will fall in love with a well-read, intelligent man, and she will never say that “love is blind”. She knows what she is looking for, and if she can’t find the source of her satisfaction and emotions in one partner for long enough, she easily trades him for a different one."
        "SEXUALITY": "The sexuality of a Gemini woman is a special thing. Gemini representatives love to be naked in general, but it is not quite the same when a naked Gemini man walks around the house, and when it is a naked Gemini lady. She isn’t a typical woman when it comes to sex. When she feels right, she will simply make the first move. As opposed to a Gemini man, she will enjoy discovering emotions within her sex life and will be surprised by their intensity and the intimacy she is capable of. She loves to experiment, change things and spice up her sex life in many different ways, and always needs new excitements.",
        "IN_RELATIONSHIPS": "Gemini woman is spontaneous and won’t stay in a relationship that doesn’t make her happy for very long. It is impossible to tie her down and protect her from the world, because this is the last thing she wants from a relationship. She is an Air goddess and needs her wings for flying. She wants to travel, move from city to city and meet new people all the time. If her partner is insecure in any way, it will be hard to tame her. Gemini is a mutable sign, and she can be adaptable when she wants to be, but she also needs enough room to be herself. When she is tied down, she becomes deeply unhappy and can seem as if she is going to wither with a possessive partner.",
        "CAN_YOU_TRUST": "If she is free to speak her mind, she will usually have no reason not to tell the truth. The ruler of Gemini is Mercury and it has an occasional need to lie about a thing or two, but this will mostly be in the scope of everyday activities and funny to talk about. In the case she feels in any way restrained, she will most certainly start lying. This is her first line of defense so she can stay true to herself and keep her own little word safe from tyranny. However, she is unpredictable and although it is the most wonderful thing about her, she cannot be trusted to be in the same relationship tomorrow, however intimate she might get.",
        "DATING": "Dating her is easy. She will be interested in a sports game as much as she will want to see a new play or go to a concert. Her partner can really take her anywhere new and she will be thrilled to have an experience she’s never had before. It is important not to keep to a routine because this is not what she wants. It might make her feel safe for a while, but in time she will feel like going crazy if the same dating scenario keeps repeating. Things need to stay interesting and fun, whatever they might be.",
        "UNDERSTANDING": "The sign of Gemini controls speech, but this doesn’t mean a Gemini woman will talk without pause for days. She wants her words to mean something and if she does talk excessively, it usually reflects her need to be heard. She yearns for tenderness given in a strangely distant manner and needs to sense things deeply beyond her mind. Change comes easy to her, but she won’t make it without reason, even if it seems like she did. She wants someone to move with her and not hold her back, gentle enough and rational enough, tall enough and smart enough. She needs a true human to love her.",
        "LIKES_AND_DISLIKES": "Her company is enjoyable and she will laugh and chat, have a lot of friends and probably fit in at any social event you can think of. When she is in love, a Gemini woman becomes strangely outspoken, caring and open hearted. Unfortunately there is no way to predict how long this will last. She is unpredictable and changes all the time, never too feminine, and rarely wants to be taken care of and protected in a typical sense.",
        "HOW_TO_CHOOSE_A_GIFT": "Choosing a gift for a Gemini woman is extremely easy. She loves presents in general and will be happy if you surprise her although it is not her birthday or Christmas. She could always use a new phone or a pretty case for it and it wouldn’t be a mistake to make her something childish and thoughtful. Write her a letter. Think of her when you go to the supermarket, as much as you would in a gift shop. By her newspaper she likes to read, or a muffin with a cup of coffee. Even if she doesn’t like muffins, she will love the attention. If this doesn’t work, you can always buy her a plane ticket or take her on a weekend away to walk through nature and feed the birds."

    "HISTORY": {
        "LINK":"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/history/gemini/,
        "HISTORY":"As other signs in the zodiac, Gemini is not in the same position as the constellation of Gemini. In the zodiac, it follows Taurus and takes the third 30 degrees of the zodiacal circle. Gemini is a mutable sign that is preceding the summer, and as such, it announces change while ruling the time of year when Taurus spring has ended, and life on Earth is about to change. Spring is dying down and preparations are done for summer to take over with the beginning of Cancer.he word “Gemini” is a Latin word for twins and it is one of the constellations that actually look like its name would suggest. The first known reference of the Gemini constellation was in Aristotle’s Meteorologica, over 300 years BC. He mentions that he observed an occulting a star in Gemini and speaks of observing Jupiter in conjunction with it. In Babylonian astronomy, these stars were known as the great twins and regarded as minor gods – Meshlamtaea (The One who has arisen from the Underworld) and Lugalirra (The Mighty King).This constellation is located between Taurus at the west and Cancer at the east. It is special because the twins from Greek mythology were not represented only by the constellation, but by actual stars which mark the twin’s heads in it. Pollux is the brightest star in Gemini and it is an orange-hued giant star, and Castor is the second brightest star in this constellation, and it is a sextuple star system which appears as a blue-white star to the unaided eye."
        "MYTH": "The myth of Gemini is a myth of Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda. Leda was the wife of Tyndareus, king of Sparta. One of the versions of this myth states that Leda got seduced or raped by Zeus disguised as a swan, on the same night when she shared a bed with her husband. As a result, she hatched two eggs from which four children were born, mortal and immortal for they have different fathers, and among them – Castor and Pollux.Castor was the mortal twin brother, and Pollux was immortal. They never fought and loved each other greatly. Pollux was known for his boxing skills and Castor as a horse tamer. Brothers aspired to marry two women who were already betrothed to two of their cousins. This lead to a family feud and Castor was fatally wounded by one of the cousins as a consequence. Zeus gave a choice to Pollux – to spend every day as an immortal at Mount Olympus among the gods, or give half of his immortality to his brother Castor. He opted for the latter, and the twins shared life and death, by spending a day at Olympus together followed by a day at Hades – the underworld.The second story is connected to the birth of the twins, in which they weren’t really Leda’s sons. By this version of the myth, Zeus fell in love with Nemesis, who was the spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris (arrogance before gods). She represented inevitability of fate to those who were godless and evil. Zeus started chasing her, acting on strong attraction he felt, and she started changing shapes to escape him. When she transformed into a goose, Zeus found her, became a swan himself, and mated with her passionately. As a result, two eggs hatched, found by Leda in the swamp and she claimed them as her own.",
        "CONNECTION": "This myth reminds us of sincere brotherly love and can manifest through the love for a brother, or a friendship that is so close that it feels like brotherhood. It tells about two people who don’t care about their differences and are prepared to do anything for each other. They could have trouble with women who already have a man in their life, and we can certainly see a picture of two men fighting over a woman. If one of them gets badly hurt, it is to be expected that the other one will give anything to help him. The sign and the constellation of Gemini represent a link of heaven and the underworld and can represent someone’s near death experience or any sort of intense contact with death.Behind the main story, there is a face of Zeus that shows a father who presented himself as something he is not, only to seduce their mother. In a truly challenging position, we can even see brothers born from rape, or adopted children whose mother left them (in a swamp). The second version of the myth tells us about overcoming the inevitable. The chase for beating inevitability is almost always present in the sign of Gemini."

        "symbol":"Gemini SymbolThe symbol for Gemini represents a companion. It also shows the Babylonian Great Twins, Greek Castor and Pollux, or a Roman figure II that stands for the number 2. This is a constellation that looks a lot like two twins holding hands, and the symbol is to present the unbreakable bond of two brothers.",
        "RULER":"The sign of Gemini is ruled by planet Mercury that got its name by the Roman god of communication, eloquence, travelers, boundaries, trickery, luck and thieves. He was also the guide of souls to the underworld. Its Greek counterpart is Hermes, a messenger, quick and cunning, moving swiftly through the worlds of mortal and divineGemini RulerThe symbol for Mercury is consisted of a circle and a cross below it, same as Venus, only with a crescent at its top. Crescent denotes the mind, circle the spirit and cross the physical matter. This symbol shows the divine nature of the mind (Gemini) and its physical one (Virgo). The “horns” made by the crescent are also linked to the winged hat that Roman god Mercury used to wear. This god was also symbolized by a caduceus – a staff with two snakes wound about it."

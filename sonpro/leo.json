    "InfoAll": "Strengths: Creative, passionate, generous, warm-hearted, cheerful, humorousWeaknesses: Arrogant, stubborn, self-centered, lazy, inflexibleLeo likes: Theater, taking holidays, being admired, expensive things, bright colors, fun with friendsLeo dislikes: Being ignored, facing difficult reality, not being treated like a king or queenPeople born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything they want to in any area of life they commit to. There is a specific strength to a Leo and their \"king of the jungle\" status. Leo often has many friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like Aries and Sagittarius. This makes them warmhearted, in love with life, trying to laugh and have a good time. Able to use their mind to solve even the most difficult problems, they will easily take initiative in resolving various complicated situations. Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in search for self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can easily ask for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other people in their chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.Leo - the Lion in the Cave The story of the Lion always speaks of bravery. This is an animal fearless and impossible to challenge, hurt or destroy, their only weaknesses being fear and aggression towards those they confront. Living in a cave, a Lion always needs to have one, nesting and finding comfort in hard times. However, they should never stay there for long. With their head high, they have to face others with dignity and respect, never raising a voice, a hand, or a weapon, bravely walking through the forest they rule.",
    "MAN":{
        "LINK":"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/man/leo/",
        "SEXUALITY": "Leo is one of the most potent men of the zodiac, but he enjoys the creative and inspiring act of sex. He doesn’t need a partner to share the same sexual relations with every day, but someone who will allow experiments and be secure enough to show their sexuality as openly as he would. Although he sticks to some traditional values, he still likes his partners strong and willful, fiery enough for the passion to flow. He will never settle down for a woman with low self-esteem who thinks of sex as a routine or an obligation. He needs to be surprised, seduced, and he wants someone to speak of his abilities, strengths and enjoy sexy communication as much as he does.",
        "IN_RELATIONSHIPS": "When he finds himself in a relationship, he will do anything to show how gallant, confident and powerful he is. This is not something that he does out of insecurity, but something that he finds necessary to seduce the subject of his desire. He will show off, make you laugh and be the biggest hero you could have ever hoped for. If anyone is waiting for Prince Charming, he might be found in Leo, for he feels and acts like royalty. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be taken quite literally and he can act as if he is a spoiled prince, lazy, bossy and thinking that he is the center of the Universe. However, he might still win you over by pointing out his incredible attributes, but turn out to be quite a disappointment if you hope he will become less selfish.",
        "LOVE": "This is a man who falls in love in an incredibly warm and cuddly way. Just think of a tamed lion, purring and making room to sit in somebody’s lap. Love will only strengthen his ego and he will truly enjoy the chase of his “prey”. Since he belongs to fixed signs of the zodiac, he might have trouble letting go of relationships that are outdated, holding on to shreds of emotion instead of searching for a new partner. This can take away a lot of his energy and he should always be free to feel the same warm and cuddly sensation that makes his heart jump. He is the king after all, and the true king has the biggest heart.",
        "CAN_YOU_TRUST": "In most cases, Leo man can be trusted, except when he simply doesn’t care about you. This is not the man that will spend his time in guilt, not secure about his decisions and choices of partners. He will lie only if he doesn’t want to deal with the boring consequences of his words, never out of fear. In general, this is not the man who is afraid, and this is what can make him such a faithful and trustful partner. Still, there are times when he doesn’t see the point of honesty because he doesn’t really want to get too attached or close to anyone. If you want to see if he should be trusted, don’t obsess. Instead, simply ask yourself – do you feel loved?",
        "DATING": "Every princess we have read about in fairytales searches for a man with the Sun in Leo. There is nothing strange about it and he is, after all, the king of the zodiac. Dating him can be just like dating the king – classy, sparkly and pompous. If you are a shy, tender soul, you will probably not enjoy the gestures of love that sometimes seem like he only wants to look good, not even to other people, but to himself. It is very important for his partner to build the intimacy during his outer performance, and this can be quite a challenge. The best thing to do is finish each date with a quiet conversation about him. The more you are interested in him, the more he will be interested in you, and this will end up in actual sharing.",
        "UNDERSTANDING": "To understand Leo, you would need to know his weaknesses and they are sometimes hard to come by. He is not that secretive, he just doesn’t want to talk about things that are emotionally difficult, and he would rather spend time in his pool of personal satisfaction than swim in negative emotions. The most important thing to remember about Leo is that his seemingly superficial nature is not superficial at all. The depth of Leo reaches to a point in which no compromise has to be made for everyone around him to be happy. He has a difficult task as a leader and a ruler, and he should be respected because of the responsibility that follows, no matter if he is aware of it or not.",
        "LIKES_AND_DISLIKES": "Leo is openhearted, grand in his gestures and easy to talk to. He is comfortable to be with, for he will enjoy a relationship full of respect and warmth. He has this beautiful hug that no other sign has. On the other hand, he can be bossy, pretentious and self-involved to the point in which it is impossible to be his partner.",
        "HOW_TO_CHOOSE_A_GIFT": "Choose something that will accent his manly physique or character. He wants to show his big shoulders or his great hair. Pack your gift in warmth, in orange, yellow and red colors. Stick to things with value that show how much you respect and cherish him. Buy him a golden watch or an expensive pen. He will like thoughtful gifts just as much, but only if you truly understand his core and are able to pick out something he always dreamed of. Play with his inner child and buy him a present that can bring him back to childhood or something that sparks his creativity."

    "WOMEN": {
        "LINK":"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/woman/leo/",
        "LOVE":"When this woman falls in love, her world starts to revolve around her partner. It is often said that Leo is self-involved, but when it is a Leo woman, her Sun is in Leo and it often represents the man she loves rather than herself. She will give everything to this man, her heart, her Soul and body, without exception. Her love is warm and passionate, she will want to fight, make up, make love and be in someone’s embrace all they long, for as long as her personal liberty isn’t endangered.",
        "SEXUALITY": "When it comes to sexuality, Leo woman is one of the most liberated women in the zodiac. She loves her body and the way she moves, and she usually won’t mind a couple of pounds over her usual weight or the underwear she wouldn’t exactly show off to enjoy sex. There is no reason for her to feel threatened or insecure, and although this can sometimes be the source of certain problems, usually it is quite refreshing for her partners. She understands sex as a natural part of life, and unless she has been badly hurt or shamed in her prior relationships, she will probably be confident, imaginative and creative.",
        "IN_RELATIONSHIPS": "She is not always easy to be with. Too much commitment is always followed by too many expectations, and she can be extremely committed. In other cases, she can be uninterested and focused on herself and her career, or other people in her life. Only when she is deeply in love will she become this mellow, warm lioness, providing soul food for her partner and their family. When she knows what she wants, there is no way to change her mind. We wouldn’t exactly call her stubborn, more like strong-willed. She cannot be bent to someone’s rules or needs and she will rarely be flexible for her partner’s irresponsible timing and any lack of respect.",
        "CAN_YOU_TRUST": "You simply know if she loves you or not. There is not much else you will need to trust her completely, because her big, warm, beating heart wouldn’t let down someone she loves. When you climb high enough on her priority list, the truth will come as natural as day and night. It is important to understand that all Leo representatives are here to shine a light on things and make them clearer, not blur them or taint them with lies and deception.",
        "DATING": "This is a woman that will want to be treated well. You could say she is high maintenance, but this really depends on her background and the way she was raised. She wants to be able to shine, to show herself with her new partner to the world. She wants to dance and spread the smell of joy, smiling and simply being happy. She needs to feel the joy of life and forget about things that make her tired and sad at her workplace, or anywhere else. Dating her can be challenging because she has enough energy to move mountains, expects the same from her chosen one, and demands that her partner takes care of their appearance all the time.",
        "UNDERSTANDING": "She is often misunderstood for grumpy and unsatisfied, as well as classified as too loud and outspoken, as if there really was such a thing as “too outspoken”. The problem in understanding this woman comes from her fiery nature and her inability to keep her mouth shut and think things through. But does she really have to? The sign of Leo is there to shine a light on us, and if that means facing us with things that are not so comfortable with, isn’t it a good thing? If you are not willing to stand up for yourself and let her show you what might need to be changed, you shouldn’t be in a relationship with this woman at all.",
        "LIKES_AND_DISLIKES": "She is someone with a great smile, the inner sense of Self, a big heart and the ability to make anything happen. Somewhere deep inside she understands that there is nothing that cannot be done and this can inspire, motivate and solve issues that stand in someone’s way. She can also sometimes be unaware of her partner’s feelings, as if she was ready to burn everything around her. She can be destructive, impose her opinions and make decisions that are not hers to make.",
        "HOW_TO_CHOOSE_A_GIFT": "There are two main types of Leo women. The first believes in natural beauty and you can recognize this type because they never wear nail polish, makeup or dye their hair, and they dress in natural colors. The second type is the woman who seems to glow in the dark. She will wear shiny, golden things, a lot of jewelry and dye her hair blonde or red. Any one of these lionesses likes to be given value, so assess the type and think about things that would show that she is the center of your world. Buy something that shines and something with value, material or other. Take her to the theater, organize her surprise birthday party and if you have a chance – walk with her down the red carpet. Tell her to look her best and take her out to the night of surprises. Make the world revolve around her for once, and she will return the favor as soon as tomorrow."

    "HISTORY": {
        "LINK":"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/history/leo/",
        "HISTORY":"THE HISTORY OF LEOThe sign of Leo does not entirely coincide with the constellation of Leo. In the zodiac, it is located between Cancer and Virgo, taking the fifth 30 degrees of the zodiacal circle. Leo is a fixed sign that comes after the summer has already begun in the sign of Cancer. It represents the hot, sunny summer, stable and unchangeable, with no sign of autumn that is to come.Leo is one of the earliest recognized constellations, documented in Mesopotamians for the first time as early as 4000 BC. Babylonians called it UR.GU.LA – the great lion. The brightest star of this constellation, Regulus, was known as “the star that stands at the Lion’s breast,” or the King Star. The constellation of Leo was also called Ser or Shir by Persians, Artan by the Turks, Aryo by the Syrians, Arye by the Jewish and Simha by the Indians, all translated as “lion”. The ancient Egyptians had great respect for the constellation of Leo, because the Sun shone in front of it at the time of annual flooding of the river Nile.This constellation has one star of the first magnitude, one of the four Royal stars, the guardian of the North – Regulus. This constellation actually resembles a lion and the brightness of Regulus with the fact that the Big Dipper points to it make it easy for us to find Leo in the night sky.",
        "MYTH": "Leo is connected to the first of twelve labors of the Greek hero Hercules, in which he had to kill the notorious Nemean Lion.The Lion lived in a cave in Nemea and terrorized the people who lived there. There was no way to defeat him because of the impenetrable skin that could not be punctured by iron, bronze or stone. When Heracles found it, he tried to shoot it with arrows and they simply bounced of the lion’s skin. When the lion entered his cave to hide, Heracles started a search for it. He needed two months to find it in that cave and finally strangled it, using its own claws to get its skin. This skin was made into a cloak, worn as a trophy and a reminder of Heracles’ strength, as well as a cloak of protection that made him look even more fearsome.The second myth written in the constellation of Leo is the myth of a tragic love affair between Pyramus and Thisbe. This is a story that looks a lot like a Shakespeare’s novel, for both lovers commit suicide by the end of it. When they arranged a secret meeting, Thisbe arrived to the meeting point first and saw a lioness with mouth bloody from her recent kill. She runs off scared and leaves her veil behind. This veil is later found by Pyramus, who kills himself thinking that the lioness killed Thisbe. She then returns to find him dead and stabs herself with the same sword.",
        "CONNECTION": "The entire myth of Leo seems quite depressing. Either Leo is killed or responsible for the death of innocent people, or love in general. Things are not that bad when you think of it from a different angle. The sign of Leo is the sign of Neptune’s fall and we can see that these myths carry the story of pretending, adultery and deadly misconceptions within. This could help us understand the need Leo representatives have to shine a light and find the truth in everything. Even the smallest lie can hurt them, or those around them, greatly.Heracles kills the indestructible lion of Nemea, but the main part of this story is the one in which the lion gets scared and hides. This speaks of the need of this constellation and the sign of Leo for bravery. It is deeply rooted that Leo mustn’t fear anything, or he could get seriously hurt. We can also see the story of lion’s claws that finished him off, meaning that any weapon, physical, emotional or verbal, will hurt the person who used it, not the one it was intended for.Still, in its good position in a personal chart, Leo represents bravery, royalty and success. It holds the story of someone strong, indestructible and fearless, for as long as the person does not act out of fear, hurting others and ending up getting hurt. Leo needs to be courageous and righteous or there won’t be much fun for them in this lifetime."

    "symbols":{

        "symbol":"Leo SymbolThe symbol for Leo is often seen as a simplified image of a lion with a head presented through the circle and the body with a tail to follow. This puts an emphasis on its tail, and all tails speak of the past and the debts we still have to repay. This is an interesting observation considering the fact that Leo represents us in our past lives. The symbol for Leo is actually a script form of the Greek letter “lambda”, the first letter of the Greek word leon, which means “lion”.",
        "RULER":"The sign of Leo is ruled by the ruler of the sky – the Sun. It holds 99% of our entire solar system and we are inside its outer sphere even though we see it as a distant celestial body. This speaks of its importance in any culture, history or astrological approach among us, on Earth. While planets are related to deities and their roles, the Sun seems to be linked to one of the myths through the lion as if it wasn’t that important at all. The truth is, the Sun is too important for humankind to label it, to capitalize it or to understand it as anything different from life itself. How can we explain the influence of the Sun, when it represents us in our purest form of light?Leo RulerWe often don’t realize that the most important thing in this symbol is its dot in the center. It symbolizes the ultimate Unity, the point in which we all become one, with each other and with the Universe. This symbol is an ancient Egyptian sign for the Sun or their god Ra, in the hieroglyphic writing system. In its history, this symbol was used as an alchemical symbol for gold, and with it for perfection of any kind. The symbol itself denotes the spirit represented through a circle, surrounding the seed of potential."
